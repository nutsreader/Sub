It's on me.

188
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,800
How was this one?

189
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,800
Not as crazy as the last one, right?

190
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
Yeah.

191
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,390
She just looked at me.

192
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,280
Maybe she knew I could see her.

193
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,120
I wish I could see them like you,

194
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,840
so I could help keep an eye out.

195
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,520
Here,

196
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,320
it's a talisman from Master Paran,

197
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,520
the OG shaman in Ubon Ratchathani.

198
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,480
You're lucky I'm his number one disciple,
or you wouldn't be getting this.

199
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,160
Master Paran...

200
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,520
The one you asked
to read my birth chart?

201
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,400
What did he say?

202
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,560
"Khemjira

203
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,280
Chandrapisut.

204
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,080
Born on June 6th."

205
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,320
How is it, Master?

206
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,520
Let your friend know

207
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,080
he'd better hurry and do what he wants.

208
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,720
He has six months

209
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,800
until he dies.

210
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,160
Die? It's that serious?

211
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,500
But...

212
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,640
is there nothing you can do?

213
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,680
Haven't I told you?

214
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,280
I don't mess with anyone's...

215
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,160
karma.

216
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,640
You're craving something cold, right?

217
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,840
Cheng sim ei, shaved ice,
bingsu, or ice cream?

218
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,360
What do you want?

219
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,000
You can't fool me.

220
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,600
What's up with my fate?

221
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,480
Why are you sidestepping it?

222
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,920
I knew it.

223
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,840
In six months,

224
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,680
I'll turn 21.

225
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,800
Forget it.

226
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,280
Come on,

227
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,280
don't give up just yet.

228
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,920
I'm sure

229
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,080
there's gotta be a way
to break that curse.

230
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,720
I'm not giving up.

231
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,240
I'm just bracing myself.

232
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
Every meeting

233
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,400
leads to a parting.

234
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,120
The bas-relief sculptures around
the base of the Democracy Monument

235
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,600
were created by
Professor Silpa Bhirasri.

236
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:31,240
The monument was commissioned in 1939.

237
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,220
These eight panels

238
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,760
depict stories and ways of life

239
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,080
following the revolution.

240
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,560
The monument has four wings,

241
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,200
each spaced 24 meters apart,

242
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,980
symbolizing the date of the revolution,

243
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,080
June 24, 1932.

244
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,440
The focal point of the monument
includes a turret

245
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,170
with six doors.

246
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:06,290
There are many more details...

247
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:10,890
Student,

248
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,370
are you okay?

249
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,410
Your time has come.

250
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,820
Your time has come.

251
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,010
Your time has come.

252
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,810
Your time has come.

253
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,410
Your time has come.

254
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,130
Your time has come.

255
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,890
- Your time has come.
- Hey!

256
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,130
Are you alright?

257
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,610
Uh... I'm okay.

258
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:59,900
The Democracy Monument symbolizes

259
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,510
progress and the future.

260
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,930
All the roads

261
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,010
extend from Ratchadamnoen Avenue

262
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,410
and lead to different provinces,

263
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,450
as we can see.

264
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,640
You wouldn't be of any help.

265
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,280
You'd be dozing off the entire class.

266
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,960
That's not funny, bro.

267
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,640
It started in Kanchanaburi.
Then, it was at your dorm.

268
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,520
Now it's even on campus?

269
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,040
It's like the curse
is trying to break you down.

270
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,920
I'm really worried about you.

271
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,360
Why don't you crash at my place
for a while?

272
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,440
If anything happens, I'll be there.

273
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,640
You're still with me?

274
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,560
Hey, Khem!

275
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,960
- Khem!
- Give me a sec.

276
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,560
I gotta go.

277
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,240
Hey, I'm Khem.

278
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,120
I live just across the hall.

279
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,800
Have you eaten yet?

280
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,640
Whoa...

281
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,000
Garlic pork with a fried egg!

282
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,000
It looks seriously tasty.

283
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,520
Wanna try some?

284
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,320
- Let go of me!
- Come here.

285
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,480
- I said let go!
- Come!

286
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,880
He's my son. I can do anything to him!

287
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,040
Why are you recording?

288
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,840
- Take him!
- You called the police on me, right?

289
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,000
Come!

290
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,400
Come on.

291
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,040
- Let go of me!
- Come with us.

292
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,800
Let go of me!

293
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,200
- We can talk somewhere else.
- Let go!

294
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,440
- What are you looking at?
- Come on!

295
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,640
- Go
- Just go!

296
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,880
You'll regret this.

297
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,080
How funny.

298
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,800
I keep seeing ghosts everywhere.

299
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,320
And yet, Mom,

300
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,880
you never came to see me.

301
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,800
Help me, Khem.

302
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,680
Khem, help me.

303
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,600
Help me, Khem.

304
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,480
Khem!

305
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,160
This is seriously messed up.

306
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,600
My master's talisman
normally lasts for a year.

307
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,640
You're staying at my place tonight.

308
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,320
If something happens,

309
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,360
I'll help you right away.

310
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,360
- I'm okay.
- I'm not asking.

311
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,920
I'm telling you.

312
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,720
How am I supposed to live without you?

313
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:03,920
Jane,

314
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,680
- Khem is staying...
- Go ahead.

315
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,480
Hello.

316
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,880
Have you eaten...

317
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,480
Leave her alone for now.

318
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,320
Probably stuck on revising her project.

319
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,400
Come on.

320
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,040
Let's go.

321
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,080
What?

322
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,880
I was almost done!

323
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,280
Khem!

324
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,210
- Mom?
- Khem...

325
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,520
Help me.

326
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:53,960
Khem!

327
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,239
- Help me.
- Mom?

328
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,000
Help me, Khem.

329
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,720
Why always me?

330
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,400
Khem,

331
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,440
please help me.

332
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,940
Jet,

333
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,400
wake up and save Khem.

334
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,640
Please.

335
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,640
Khem!

336
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,640
Come to me.

337
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,020
Khem!

338
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,040
Don't go.

339
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:41,080
(Chanting)

340
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,320
Jet, please save Khem.

341
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,120
Khem, come to me.

342
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,320
Let go!

343
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,400
I'm saving my mom.

344
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,560
Khem!

345
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,640
Khem, come to me.

346
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,640
Khem!

347
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,970
Khem!

348
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,640
Get a grip!

349
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,380
Wait...

350
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,040
Why am I here?

351
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,560
I don't know.

352
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,360
You almost fell, you know.

353
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,040
The amulet's lost its power,

354
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,440
and the talisman's worn out.

355
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,120
I honestly don't know
if I can handle what's coming.

356
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,600
Once the semester break starts,

357
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,120
I'm going straight back
to see my father.

358
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,240
I'm sorry, Jet.

359
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,440
I don't think I'll be joining...

360
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,720
the volunteer camp this year.

361
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,320
Why would you be sorry?

362
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,400
Your life matters the most, man.

363
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,680
Hey, guys,

364
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,760
listen up.

365
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,520
Put it down.

366
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,560
There's a storm hitting the south,

367
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,920
so the uni's concerned about our safety.

368
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,640
Looks like we might have to
cancel the camp this break.

369
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,720
- Jeez.
- What?

370
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,520
- How come?
- Everything's ready.

371
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,960
- Gosh.
- All are ready.

372
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,160
- What a waste of time.
- What about my alcohol?

373
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,960
Hey, leave it to me.

374
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,400
Can't we go somewhere else instead?

375
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,360
Yeah, right.

376
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,920
It's way too sudden.

377
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,280
Getting approval from the village

378
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,170
and sending a new request to the uni...

379
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,430
They'll take too long.

380
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,560
We can go again next year.

381
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
What, Jet?

382
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,480
He told us to listen.

383
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,520
I have an idea.

384
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,080
Hey!

385
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,160
Let's go to Ubon Ratchathani.

386
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,160
Ubon Ratchathani?

387
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,400
Well, my friend's been hoping
to go there for three years.

388
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,440
Is Jet coming back, Uncle Chai?

389
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,080
That's right, Master.

390
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,800
He called me the other day,

391
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,160
saying he wanted to bring his friends
for a volunteer camp here.

392
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,200
He mentioned wanting to stay
at your house, too.

393
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,040
So...

394
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,960
if I were to move up the ceremony
to welcome them,

395
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,200
would that be alright with you?

396
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,900
I'll find a new date for you.

397
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,480
Okay.

398
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,200
I'll take my leave, then.

399
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,760
Thong, Jet's coming back this break!

400
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,360
I know that already!

401
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,680
I was with you the whole time.

402
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,160
Master,

403
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,280
can you remove the spell
blocking Jet's sight this time?

404
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,520
We wanna play with him again.

405
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,160
- Please.
- Please.

406
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,160
Yeah, like that. Exactly.

407
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,120
Lower your lips
and keep your cheeks nicely puffed.

408
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,960
Yeah.

409
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,200
Now, frown.

410
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,480
Sob, too.

411
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,080
I really have no choice.

412
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,840
Please,

413
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,380
can you...

414
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,380
help me,

415
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,900
Master?

416
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,080
Perfect!

417
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,080
Master or not,

418
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,880
even a heart of steel

419
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,440
would melt in front of this.

420
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,400
What are you staring at, Charn?

421
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,760
Which one do you like?

422
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,800
Khem or Jet?

423
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,160
No!

424
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,200
It's not like that.

425
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,680
I mean,

426
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,080
is there something weird
about those two?

427
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,080
Come on, you missed last year's camp.
You wouldn't know them.

428
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,720
They're really nice.

429
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,960
Especially Jet, he's hilarious.

430
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,410
What's so weird about them?

431
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,000
Charn, check this out!

432
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,740
Have you been to Ubon Ratchathani?

433
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,520
Look, there are seven
recommended dishes there,

434
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,200
- like pork sausages and Vietnamese soup.
- You took forever.

435
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,640
- Hey, you're in my way.
- Should we try them?

436
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,440
Move.

437
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,480
Sit here.

438
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,460
Ouch!

439
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:41,160
- Are you okay, Prae?
- It really hurts, babe.

440
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,240
- Too much love here.
- What's your problem?

441
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,520
Are you guys fighting now?

442
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,240
- Love is gross.
- Argh.

443
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,960
Alright, since you're all here,

444
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
let's hit the road.

445
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,040
Let's go!

446
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,920
You think it's okay?

447
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,010
Dance harder, come on!

448
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,880
Here we go.

449
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,720
I look stunning here.

450
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:48,920
Hey,

451
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,640
why are we taking this route?

452
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,240
It's a shortcut.

453
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,200
Our driver wants to get there quickly.

454
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,240
But this is...

455
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,720
What's wrong with this route?

456
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,160
Jet!

457
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,440
What?

458
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,320
Guys!

459
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:22,680
What?

460
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:38,210
What's happening, Jet?

461
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,640
I knew it.

462
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,520
This route is full of anguished spirits.

463
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,600
My master's warned me not to take it.

464
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,000
We're really in deep shit.

465
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,120
They're everywhere, right?

466
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,560
There's evil energy all around.

467
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,880
Do restless spirits
usually haunt people this closely, Jet?

468
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,320
This is not usual.

469
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,480
Where are you going?

470
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,710
Why not chant and repel them?

471
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,520
We can't. There are too many of them.

472
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,760
Let's just drive away.

473
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,240
Sir!

474
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,120
Hey!

475
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:01,840
Sir,

476
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,200
wake up!

477
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,520
Sir,

478
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,200
come on. Wake up!

479
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,280
Hey, what are you doing?

480
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,980
They're only after me, aren't they?

481
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,400
There's no point in doing that.

482
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,440
Stop that.

483
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,280
Let me go!

484
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,360
Master!

485
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,320
I knew

486
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,610
that if I, your number one disciple,
were in trouble,

487
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:20,720
you would come to help,
no matter where I might be.

488
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,160
Thank you...

489
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,680
Oh?

490
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,940
Why are you here in a spirit form?

491
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,720
Something's up at the village.

492
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,400
Hurry and wake the driver.

493
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,560
Make sure you get there before dark.

494
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,880
What?

495
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,000
Hurry, Master.

496
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,040
Chompoo's probably gone crazy already.

497
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,680
Chompoo!

498
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,440
- Chompoo!
- Stay away from me!

499
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,560
Chompoo...

500
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,440
Let me go!

501
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,680
I said to let go!

502
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,440
Go away!

503
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,990
- Just leave me alone!
- What's going on? Let's see.

504
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,320
- Let go of me!
- Chompoo!

505
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,790
- Keep her down.
- Piss off!

506
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,320
- What are they doing?
- Get your hands off me.

507
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,840
It's an exorcism.

508
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:54,680
Come on.

509
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,080
Chompoo!

510
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,280
Chompoo...

511
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,040
Go!

512
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:03,960
Right here.

513
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,800
Piss off!

514
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,200
- Go away!
- Hey,

515
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,360
- don't let her go.
- Hurry.

516
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,630
- Come on, sweetie.
- Go away!

517
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:11,400
- What's wrong with you?
- Don't move.

518
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,840
Come on, help us.

519
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,720
- Make sure it's tied firmly.
- Piss off.

520
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,680
I'm getting chills.

521
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,600
- You scared?
- I gotta take a dump.

522
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,080
- Let me go!
- Asshole.

523
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,760
Stay out of this.

524
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,600
This body belongs to me now.

525
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,080
What did she ever do to you?

526
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,200
Do not burden yourself
with further karma.

527
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,560
I won't.

528
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,960
I've loved her since I was alive.

529
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,820
Even in death,

530
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,540
I'm not leaving her ever!

531
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:51,160
(Incanting)

532
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,100
- Chompoo...
- Just let go.

533
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,000
Mom...

534
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,760
Set the one you love free
so she can be happy.

535
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,560
Come on.

536
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,600
Take her there.

537
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,800
- Together.
- Alright.

538
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,800
Slowly. Be careful.

539
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:16,760
- Take it easy, sweetie.
- Take the bag away.

540
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,160
The tray, too.

541
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,760
Keep your face up, sweetie.

542
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,760
This is my friend, Khemjira.

543
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:34,880
And...

544
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,000
action!

545
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Uh...

546
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:45,740
Hello,

547
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:46,800
Master...

548
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,280
My face must be worn out by now.

549
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,720
If you're staying at my place,

550
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,160
get there before dark.

551
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:52,880
Okay.

552
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,440
What's up with you?

553
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,800
We even practiced that on the bus.

554
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,420
Follow him, guys.

555
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,240
Is that heavy?

556
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,520
Get their beds ready.

557
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,560
- Okay.
- Let me help.

558
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,560
Alright.

559
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,440
- Let's go.
- This one!

560
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,840
- We gotta hurry.
- Hello.

561
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,710
You can share a room with us.

562
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:28,720
- Yeah, okay!
- Whoa.

563
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,600
- That's dope.
- Let's do that, bro.

564
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,760
- I just saw...
- Who said that?

565
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,600
Hey,

566
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,480
you're staring at them again.

567
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,960
What's got you wondering now?

568
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,720
Where are they going?

569
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,240
Aren't you curious, too?

570
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,270
I mean...

571
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:46,190
Didn't you see them
talking to that shaman?

572
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,280
Exactly.

573
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,360
He insisted that everyone come here.

574
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,000
Right when we arrived,

575
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,600
there was an exorcism.

576
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,480
It feels like they set us up
to join some kind of cult.

577
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,120
Isn't that a bit suspicious?

578
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,920
Come on, Charn.

579
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,720
You've been watching too many movies.

580
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:04,880
Chill out.

581
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,720
Why bother worrying about them so much?

582
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,800
It's pretty far.

583
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,920
Right here.

584
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,800
They're here.

585
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:27,880
Jet.

586
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,280
Jet!

587
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,200
Dotty!

588
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,000
Come on.

589
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,360
- He has a dog?
- Come here.

590
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:42,880
- Come to me.
- Dotty.

591
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,720
Come on.

592
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:45,760
What?

593
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,280
What the heck?

594
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,640
- You know each other?
- Baby Dotty!

595
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:53,840
Paw.

596
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,140
Good girl.

597
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,280
So clever.

598
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,480
Go away.

599
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,990
You're not welcome here.

600
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,080
What, Master?

601
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,280
You told us to get here.

602
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,640
If we're not welcome,

603
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:17,840
we should just leave.

604
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,120
So it's you.

605
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,600
Get out of my place.

606
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,760
That guy...

607
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,280
Do you know him, Master?

608
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,040
Show your friend to the room.

609
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,960
Whatever you need, help yourself.

610
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,400
We need to talk tonight.

611
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,240
Okay.

612
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:39,360
Come on.

613
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,380
Jet,

614
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,920
is Master always this cold?

615
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,560
Well...

616
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,920
No.

617
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,360
He's usually worse than this.

618
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,840
This is him being soft.

619
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,960
But don't worry.

620
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,160
He might look cold,

621
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,000
but if someone's in trouble,

622
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,000
he always helps.

623
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,680
I feel like I'm a burden.

624
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,440
I should've...

625
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,640
never come here in the first place.

626
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,320
Come on, you're not a burden.

627
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,720
Get some sleep.

628
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:09,520
Hey, where are you going?

629
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,520
To face my karma.

630
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,440
Haven't been beaten in so long.

631
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,560
I really miss the good old days.

632
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,800
How about another one?

633
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,520
You just never listen to me.

634
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,280
I told you to stay out of it.

635
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,000
Well...

636
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,080
Khem's a good guy.

637
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,880
When I first met him,

638
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,960
it felt like...

639
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,800
we'd known each other forever.

640
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:07,640
By the way,

641
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:09,900
that spirit you drove away...

642
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:12,040
Was he Khem's karmic enemy?

643
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:13,760
No.

644
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,000
Now,

645
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,440
remember those frenzied spirits?

646
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,120
His true karmic enemy

647
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,760
has the power to control them all.

648
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,560
It's gone this far,

649
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:35,440
and you still want to help him?

650
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,320
Yes.

651
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,040
I stand by my words.

652
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,920
Please help him, Master.

653
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,040
If you don't,

654
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,160
I'm leaking your number.

655
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,400
I won't promise I can save him.

656
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,320
You'd better go keep him safe.

657
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,280
The night's far from over.

658
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,920
Master seems to care about Khem, though.

659
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,560
Didn't he say he wouldn't...

660
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,000
We'd better be ready, too.

661
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:31,600
(Chanting)

662
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,080
Be careful.

663
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,280
Don't worry.

664
01:00:58,840 --> 01:00:59,840
He's on his way.

665
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,480
- He's here.
- That's him.

666
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,600
Here he is.

667
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:03,960
- Hey.
- Mister.

668
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,880
Is everyone here?

669
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,160
- Yeah, Mister.
- Yes.

670
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,120
- Let's go.
- Okay.

671
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,320
- Alright.
- Go.

672
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,120
Everyone, are you ready?

673
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,120
- Yes.
- We are.

674
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:19,880
Let's do it.

675
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,920
They're here.

676
01:01:53,990 --> 01:02:11,390
(Incanting)

677
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,760
Are you looking for me?

678
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,380
What has he done to you?

679
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:17,760
Can't you just let him go?

680
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,200
I shall never let him go.

681
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:22,660
This is Charn,

682
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:23,680
also a junior.

683
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:24,480
This is Jet,

684
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:25,520
my best friend.

685
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,160
We've gone through this bamboo grove
over and over.

686
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,900
My duty

687
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:36,600
is to take care
of the people in this village.

688
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:41,040
I'll do whatever it takes
to stop being an outsider in your eyes.
