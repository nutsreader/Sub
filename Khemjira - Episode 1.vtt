25:40.450 --> 25:42.130
Your time has come.

25:42.170 --> 25:43.890
- Your time has come.
- Hey!

25:46.530 --> 25:48.130
Are you alright?

25:50.010 --> 25:51.610
Uh... I'm okay.

25:56.290 --> 25:59.900
The Democracy Monument symbolizes

25:59.940 --> 26:02.510
progress and the future.

26:02.980 --> 26:04.930
All the roads

26:04.970 --> 26:08.010
extend from Ratchadamnoen Avenue

26:08.210 --> 26:11.410
and lead to different provinces,

26:12.250 --> 26:13.450
as we can see.

26:16.160 --> 26:17.640
You wouldn't be of any help.

26:18.400 --> 26:20.280
You'd be dozing off the entire class.

26:22.400 --> 26:23.960
That's not funny, bro.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.640
It started in Kanchanaburi.
Then, it was at your dorm.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.520
Now it's even on campus?

26:29.680 --> 26:32.040
It's like the curse
is trying to break you down.

26:32.320 --> 26:33.920
I'm really worried about you.

26:34.360 --> 26:37.360
Why don't you crash at my place
for a while?

26:37.640 --> 26:39.440
If anything happens, I'll be there.

26:40.640 --> 26:41.640
You're still with me?

26:42.480 --> 26:43.560
Hey, Khem!

26:43.600 --> 26:44.960
- Khem!
- Give me a sec.

26:56.560 --> 26:57.560
I gotta go.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.240
Hey, I'm Khem.

28:11.640 --> 28:13.120
I live just across the hall.

28:15.200 --> 28:16.800
Have you eaten yet?

28:38.640 --> 28:39.640
Whoa...

28:40.200 --> 28:42.000
Garlic pork with a fried egg!

28:42.520 --> 28:44.000
It looks seriously tasty.

28:47.400 --> 28:48.520
Wanna try some?

29:39.360 --> 29:40.320
- Let go of me!
- Come here.

29:40.360 --> 29:41.480
- I said let go!
- Come!

29:41.520 --> 29:42.880
He's my son. I can do anything to him!

29:43.640 --> 29:45.040
Why are you recording?

29:45.080 --> 29:46.840
- Take him!
- You called the police on me, right?

29:47.200 --> 29:48.000
Come!

29:48.520 --> 29:49.400
Come on.

29:49.840 --> 29:51.040
- Let go of me!
- Come with us.

29:51.080 --> 29:51.800
Let go of me!

29:51.840 --> 29:53.200
- We can talk somewhere else.
- Let go!

29:53.480 --> 29:55.440
- What are you looking at?
- Come on!

29:55.480 --> 29:56.640
- Go
- Just go!

29:56.680 --> 29:57.880
You'll regret this.

30:17.080 --> 30:18.080
How funny.

30:19.200 --> 30:20.800
I keep seeing ghosts everywhere.

30:27.040 --> 30:28.320
And yet, Mom,

30:30.280 --> 30:31.880
you never came to see me.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.800
Help me, Khem.

30:49.040 --> 30:51.680
Khem, help me.

30:54.880 --> 30:57.600
Help me, Khem.

31:07.680 --> 31:08.480
Khem!

32:06.960 --> 32:09.160
This is seriously messed up.

32:09.600 --> 32:11.600
My master's talisman
normally lasts for a year.

32:15.960 --> 32:17.640
You're staying at my place tonight.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.320
If something happens,

32:19.360 --> 32:20.360
I'll help you right away.

32:27.120 --> 32:28.360
- I'm okay.
- I'm not asking.

32:28.920 --> 32:29.920
I'm telling you.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.720
How am I supposed to live without you?

33:03.080 --> 33:03.920
Jane,

33:03.960 --> 33:05.680
- Khem is staying...
- Go ahead.

33:10.480 --> 33:11.480
Hello.

33:11.800 --> 33:13.880
Have you eaten...

33:14.280 --> 33:15.480
Leave her alone for now.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.320
Probably stuck on revising her project.

33:18.710 --> 33:19.400
Come on.

33:19.640 --> 33:21.040
Let's go.

33:44.360 --> 33:45.080
What?

33:48.680 --> 33:49.880
I was almost done!

34:45.080 --> 34:47.280
Khem!

34:48.670 --> 34:50.210
- Mom?
- Khem...

34:50.719 --> 34:52.520
Help me.

34:53.020 --> 34:53.960
Khem!

34:54.000 --> 34:56.239
- Help me.
- Mom?

34:58.200 --> 35:01.000
Help me, Khem.

35:33.720 --> 35:34.720
Why always me?

35:42.040 --> 35:43.400
Khem,

35:43.440 --> 35:45.440
please help me.

35:54.080 --> 35:54.940
Jet,

35:54.980 --> 35:56.400
wake up and save Khem.

35:56.440 --> 35:57.640
Please.

36:05.480 --> 36:06.640
Khem!

36:07.040 --> 36:08.640
Come to me.

36:10.080 --> 36:11.020
Khem!

36:14.840 --> 36:16.040
Don't go.

36:30.720 --> 36:41.080
(Chanting)

36:41.120 --> 36:43.320
Jet, please save Khem.

36:46.520 --> 36:48.120
Khem, come to me.

36:50.520 --> 36:51.320
Let go!

36:56.280 --> 36:57.400
I'm saving my mom.

36:57.840 --> 36:58.560
Khem!

37:03.640 --> 37:05.640
Khem, come to me.

37:05.840 --> 37:06.640
Khem!

37:07.120 --> 37:07.970
Khem!

37:08.640 --> 37:09.640
Get a grip!

37:16.720 --> 37:17.380
Wait...

37:18.920 --> 37:20.040
Why am I here?

37:21.800 --> 37:22.560
I don't know.

37:22.960 --> 37:24.360
You almost fell, you know.

37:35.840 --> 37:37.040
The amulet's lost its power,

37:37.240 --> 37:38.440
and the talisman's worn out.

37:39.120 --> 37:41.120
I honestly don't know
if I can handle what's coming.

37:45.320 --> 37:46.600
Once the semester break starts,

37:47.120 --> 37:49.120
I'm going straight back
to see my father.

37:50.840 --> 37:52.240
I'm sorry, Jet.

37:53.120 --> 37:54.440
I don't think I'll be joining...

37:55.400 --> 37:56.720
the volunteer camp this year.

37:57.320 --> 37:58.320
Why would you be sorry?

37:58.880 --> 38:00.400
Your life matters the most, man.

38:02.680 --> 38:03.680
Hey, guys,

38:04.760 --> 38:05.760
listen up.

38:07.120 --> 38:08.520
Put it down.

38:09.960 --> 38:11.560
There's a storm hitting the south,

38:12.800 --> 38:14.920
so the uni's concerned about our safety.

38:15.680 --> 38:18.640
Looks like we might have to
cancel the camp this break.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.720
- Jeez.
- What?

38:20.760 --> 38:22.520
- How come?
- Everything's ready.

38:22.560 --> 38:23.960
- Gosh.
- All are ready.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.160
- What a waste of time.
- What about my alcohol?

38:25.200 --> 38:26.960
Hey, leave it to me.

38:27.840 --> 38:29.400
Can't we go somewhere else instead?

38:29.440 --> 38:30.360
Yeah, right.

38:32.520 --> 38:33.920
It's way too sudden.

38:34.840 --> 38:36.280
Getting approval from the village

38:36.560 --> 38:38.170
and sending a new request to the uni...

38:39.320 --> 38:40.430
They'll take too long.

38:40.470 --> 38:41.560
We can go again next year.

38:48.480 --> 38:49.480
What, Jet?

38:50.120 --> 38:51.480
He told us to listen.

38:51.520 --> 38:52.520
I have an idea.

38:54.360 --> 38:55.080
Hey!

38:56.160 --> 38:57.160
Let's go to Ubon Ratchathani.

39:02.160 --> 39:03.160
Ubon Ratchathani?

39:09.320 --> 39:12.400
Well, my friend's been hoping
to go there for three years.

39:12.440 --> 39:14.440
Is Jet coming back, Uncle Chai?

39:16.080 --> 39:17.080
That's right, Master.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.800
He called me the other day,

39:20.400 --> 39:24.160
saying he wanted to bring his friends
for a volunteer camp here.

39:24.440 --> 39:27.200
He mentioned wanting to stay
at your house, too.

39:27.640 --> 39:29.040
So...

39:29.080 --> 39:31.960
if I were to move up the ceremony
to welcome them,

39:32.160 --> 39:33.200
would that be alright with you?

39:33.800 --> 39:34.900
I'll find a new date for you.

39:36.680 --> 39:37.480
Okay.

39:37.800 --> 39:39.200
I'll take my leave, then.

39:58.960 --> 40:01.760
Thong, Jet's coming back this break!

40:01.800 --> 40:03.360
I know that already!

40:03.400 --> 40:04.680
I was with you the whole time.

40:08.080 --> 40:09.160
Master,

40:09.400 --> 40:13.280
can you remove the spell
blocking Jet's sight this time?

40:13.760 --> 40:16.520
We wanna play with him again.

40:16.560 --> 40:20.160
- Please.
- Please.

40:28.160 --> 40:30.160
Yeah, like that. Exactly.

40:30.200 --> 40:32.120
Lower your lips
and keep your cheeks nicely puffed.

40:33.120 --> 40:33.960
Yeah.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.200
Now, frown.

40:35.360 --> 40:36.480
Sob, too.

40:39.720 --> 40:43.080
I really have no choice.

40:43.440 --> 40:44.840
Please,

40:45.920 --> 40:47.380
can you...

40:48.060 --> 40:49.380
help me,

40:49.560 --> 40:50.900
Master?

40:51.160 --> 40:52.080
Perfect!

40:52.840 --> 40:54.080
Master or not,

40:54.360 --> 40:55.880
even a heart of steel

40:56.080 --> 40:57.440
would melt in front of this.

40:57.800 --> 40:59.400
What are you staring at, Charn?

40:59.880 --> 41:00.760
Which one do you like?

41:00.800 --> 41:01.800
Khem or Jet?

41:02.520 --> 41:03.160
No!

41:03.200 --> 41:04.200
It's not like that.

41:04.800 --> 41:05.680
I mean,

41:07.200 --> 41:10.080
is there something weird
about those two?

41:10.120 --> 41:13.080
Come on, you missed last year's camp.
You wouldn't know them.

41:13.120 --> 41:14.720
They're really nice.

41:14.760 --> 41:16.960
Especially Jet, he's hilarious.

41:20.120 --> 41:21.410
What's so weird about them?

41:24.280 --> 41:26.000
Charn, check this out!

41:26.540 --> 41:27.740
Have you been to Ubon Ratchathani?

41:28.840 --> 41:31.520
Look, there are seven
recommended dishes there,

41:31.560 --> 41:33.200
- like pork sausages and Vietnamese soup.
- You took forever.

41:33.240 --> 41:34.640
- Hey, you're in my way.
- Should we try them?

41:34.680 --> 41:35.440
Move.

41:35.480 --> 41:36.480
Sit here.

41:37.620 --> 41:38.460
Ouch!

41:38.670 --> 41:41.160
- Are you okay, Prae?
- It really hurts, babe.

41:45.480 --> 41:47.240
- Too much love here.
- What's your problem?

41:47.480 --> 41:48.520
Are you guys fighting now?

41:48.560 --> 41:50.240
- Love is gross.
- Argh.

41:50.280 --> 41:51.960
Alright, since you're all here,

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
let's hit the road.

41:53.040 --> 41:55.040
Let's go!

42:00.960 --> 42:01.920
You think it's okay?

42:06.420 --> 42:08.010
Dance harder, come on!

42:08.920 --> 42:09.880
Here we go.

42:14.800 --> 42:15.720
I look stunning here.

42:48.280 --> 42:48.920
Hey,

42:49.640 --> 42:50.640
why are we taking this route?

42:51.120 --> 42:52.240
It's a shortcut.

42:52.440 --> 42:54.200
Our driver wants to get there quickly.

42:54.240 --> 42:55.240
But this is...

43:05.320 --> 43:06.720
What's wrong with this route?

44:13.280 --> 44:14.160
Jet!

44:18.720 --> 44:19.440
What?

44:20.560 --> 44:21.320
Guys!

44:21.960 --> 44:22.680
What?

44:36.930 --> 44:38.210
What's happening, Jet?

44:39.400 --> 44:40.640
I knew it.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.520
This route is full of anguished spirits.

44:46.240 --> 44:48.600
My master's warned me not to take it.

45:31.520 --> 45:33.000
We're really in deep shit.

45:33.560 --> 45:35.120
They're everywhere, right?

45:35.160 --> 45:36.560
There's evil energy all around.

45:37.680 --> 45:40.880
Do restless spirits
usually haunt people this closely, Jet?

45:40.920 --> 45:42.320
This is not usual.

45:52.600 --> 45:53.480
Where are you going?

45:53.520 --> 45:54.710
Why not chant and repel them?

45:54.920 --> 45:56.520
We can't. There are too many of them.

45:56.760 --> 45:57.760
Let's just drive away.

45:59.600 --> 46:00.240
Sir!

46:00.480 --> 46:01.120
Hey!

46:01.160 --> 46:01.840
Sir,

46:02.320 --> 46:03.200
wake up!

46:04.840 --> 46:05.520
Sir,

46:05.880 --> 46:07.200
come on. Wake up!

46:14.840 --> 46:16.280
Hey, what are you doing?

46:16.320 --> 46:17.980
They're only after me, aren't they?

46:18.020 --> 46:19.400
There's no point in doing that.

46:19.440 --> 46:20.440
Stop that.

46:20.480 --> 46:21.280
Let me go!

46:54.480 --> 46:55.360
Master!

47:13.680 --> 47:15.320
I knew

47:15.360 --> 47:17.610
that if I, your number one disciple,
were in trouble,

47:17.650 --> 47:20.720
you would come to help,
no matter where I might be.

47:21.880 --> 47:23.160
Thank you...

47:24.800 --> 47:25.680
Oh?

47:26.320 --> 47:27.940
Why are you here in a spirit form?

47:27.980 --> 47:29.720
Something's up at the village.

47:30.760 --> 47:32.400
Hurry and wake the driver.

47:32.840 --> 47:34.560
Make sure you get there before dark.

47:36.000 --> 47:36.880
What?

48:29.920 --> 48:31.000
Hurry, Master.

48:31.040 --> 48:33.040
Chompoo's probably gone crazy already.

48:34.600 --> 48:36.680
Chompoo!

48:38.200 --> 48:39.440
- Chompoo!
- Stay away from me!

48:39.480 --> 48:40.560
Chompoo...

48:40.600 --> 48:41.440
Let me go!

48:42.200 --> 48:43.680
I said to let go!

48:43.720 --> 48:44.440
Go away!

48:44.480 --> 48:46.990
- Just leave me alone!
- What's going on? Let's see.

48:47.750 --> 48:49.320
- Let go of me!
- Chompoo!

48:49.360 --> 48:50.790
- Keep her down.
- Piss off!

48:50.830 --> 48:52.320
- What are they doing?
- Get your hands off me.

48:52.360 --> 48:53.840
It's an exorcism.

48:53.880 --> 48:54.680
Come on.

48:59.200 --> 49:00.080
Chompoo!

49:00.120 --> 49:01.280
Chompoo...

49:02.400 --> 49:03.040
Go!

49:03.240 --> 49:03.960
Right here.

49:04.680 --> 49:05.800
Piss off!

49:06.000 --> 49:07.200
- Go away!
- Hey,

49:07.240 --> 49:08.360
- don't let her go.
- Hurry.

49:08.400 --> 49:09.630
- Come on, sweetie.
- Go away!

49:09.670 --> 49:11.400
- What's wrong with you?
- Don't move.

49:12.960 --> 49:13.840
Come on, help us.

49:14.360 --> 49:15.720
- Make sure it's tied firmly.
- Piss off.

49:17.480 --> 49:18.680
I'm getting chills.

49:19.080 --> 49:20.600
- You scared?
- I gotta take a dump.

49:20.640 --> 49:22.080
- Let me go!
- Asshole.

49:23.360 --> 49:24.760
Stay out of this.

49:25.020 --> 49:26.600
This body belongs to me now.

49:26.880 --> 49:28.080
What did she ever do to you?

49:28.720 --> 49:30.200
Do not burden yourself
with further karma.

49:30.560 --> 49:31.560
I won't.

49:32.040 --> 49:33.960
I've loved her since I was alive.

49:34.640 --> 49:35.820
Even in death,

49:36.060 --> 49:37.540
I'm not leaving her ever!

49:39.160 --> 49:51.160
(Incanting)

50:00.680 --> 50:02.100
- Chompoo...
- Just let go.

50:02.140 --> 50:03.000
Mom...

50:03.040 --> 50:05.760
Set the one you love free
so she can be happy.

50:07.680 --> 50:08.560
Come on.

50:08.720 --> 50:09.600
Take her there.

50:09.920 --> 50:10.800
- Together.
- Alright.

50:10.920 --> 50:12.800
Slowly. Be careful.

50:15.070 --> 50:16.760
- Take it easy, sweetie.
- Take the bag away.

50:17.050 --> 50:18.160
The tray, too.

50:20.840 --> 50:21.760
Keep your face up, sweetie.

50:29.960 --> 50:31.760
This is my friend, Khemjira.

50:34.200 --> 50:34.880
And...

50:34.920 --> 50:36.000
action!

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
Uh...

50:45.200 --> 50:45.740
Hello,

50:45.780 --> 50:46.800
Master...

51:39.480 --> 51:41.280
My face must be worn out by now.

51:48.480 --> 51:49.720
If you're staying at my place,

51:49.880 --> 51:51.160
get there before dark.

51:52.200 --> 51:52.880
Okay.

52:05.560 --> 52:06.440
What's up with you?

52:07.320 --> 52:08.800
We even practiced that on the bus.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.420
Follow him, guys.

52:12.460 --> 52:13.240
Is that heavy?

52:13.280 --> 52:14.520
Get their beds ready.

52:14.560 --> 52:15.560
- Okay.
- Let me help.

52:15.600 --> 52:16.560
Alright.

52:19.560 --> 52:20.440
- Let's go.
- This one!

52:20.480 --> 52:21.840
- We gotta hurry.
- Hello.

52:23.520 --> 52:27.710
You can share a room with us.

52:27.750 --> 52:28.720
- Yeah, okay!
- Whoa.

52:28.760 --> 52:30.600
- That's dope.
- Let's do that, bro.

52:30.640 --> 52:32.760
- I just saw...
- Who said that?

52:32.800 --> 52:33.600
Hey,

52:33.960 --> 52:35.480
you're staring at them again.

52:35.760 --> 52:36.960
What's got you wondering now?

52:39.360 --> 52:40.720
Where are they going?

52:40.880 --> 52:42.240
Aren't you curious, too?

52:43.080 --> 52:44.270
I mean...

52:44.310 --> 52:46.190
Didn't you see them
talking to that shaman?

52:46.480 --> 52:47.280
Exactly.

52:48.160 --> 52:50.360
He insisted that everyone come here.

52:50.760 --> 52:52.000
Right when we arrived,

52:52.120 --> 52:53.600
there was an exorcism.

52:54.280 --> 52:57.480
It feels like they set us up
to join some kind of cult.

52:57.720 --> 52:59.120
Isn't that a bit suspicious?

53:00.440 --> 53:01.920
Come on, Charn.

53:01.960 --> 53:03.720
You've been watching too many movies.

53:04.040 --> 53:04.880
Chill out.

53:04.920 --> 53:06.720
Why bother worrying about them so much?

53:17.920 --> 53:18.800
It's pretty far.

53:18.960 --> 53:19.920
Right here.

53:19.960 --> 53:21.800
They're here.

53:27.160 --> 53:27.880
Jet.

53:27.920 --> 53:29.280
Jet!

53:37.400 --> 53:38.200
Dotty!

53:39.200 --> 53:40.000
Come on.

53:40.160 --> 53:41.360
- He has a dog?
- Come here.

53:42.080 --> 53:42.880
- Come to me.
- Dotty.

53:43.840 --> 53:44.720
Come on.

53:45.040 --> 53:45.760
What?

53:46.440 --> 53:47.280
What the heck?

53:47.560 --> 53:49.640
- You know each other?
- Baby Dotty!

53:53.040 --> 53:53.840
Paw.

53:54.040 --> 53:55.140
Good girl.

53:55.180 --> 53:56.280
So clever.

53:57.280 --> 53:58.480
Go away.

53:59.760 --> 54:00.990
You're not welcome here.

54:03.760 --> 54:05.080
What, Master?

54:06.200 --> 54:07.280
You told us to get here.

54:15.320 --> 54:16.640
If we're not welcome,

54:16.840 --> 54:17.840
we should just leave.

54:44.920 --> 54:46.120
So it's you.

54:47.280 --> 54:48.600
Get out of my place.

55:02.360 --> 55:03.760
That guy...

55:04.760 --> 55:06.280
Do you know him, Master?

55:10.520 --> 55:12.040
Show your friend to the room.

55:12.760 --> 55:14.960
Whatever you need, help yourself.

55:16.360 --> 55:18.400
We need to talk tonight.

55:18.440 --> 55:19.240
Okay.

55:38.170 --> 55:39.360
Come on.

55:52.480 --> 55:53.380
Jet,

55:53.720 --> 55:55.920
is Master always this cold?

55:58.160 --> 55:59.560
Well...

55:59.920 --> 56:00.920
No.

56:05.360 --> 56:06.360
He's usually worse than this.

56:06.840 --> 56:07.840
This is him being soft.

56:16.960 --> 56:18.960
But don't worry.

56:19.960 --> 56:21.160
He might look cold,

56:22.200 --> 56:24.000
but if someone's in trouble,

56:24.760 --> 56:26.000
he always helps.

56:40.960 --> 56:42.680
I feel like I'm a burden.

56:44.440 --> 56:45.440
I should've...

56:47.120 --> 56:48.640
never come here in the first place.

56:48.880 --> 56:51.320
Come on, you're not a burden.

56:51.720 --> 56:52.720
Get some sleep.

57:07.460 --> 57:09.520
Hey, where are you going?

57:12.520 --> 57:13.520
To face my karma.

57:32.840 --> 57:34.440
Haven't been beaten in so long.

57:36.080 --> 57:37.560
I really miss the good old days.

57:37.600 --> 57:38.800
How about another one?

57:39.120 --> 57:40.520
You just never listen to me.

57:41.280 --> 57:43.280
I told you to stay out of it.

57:44.200 --> 57:45.000
Well...

57:46.280 --> 57:48.080
Khem's a good guy.

57:54.280 --> 57:55.880
When I first met him,

57:56.360 --> 57:57.960
it felt like...

57:58.280 --> 57:59.800
we'd known each other forever.

58:06.920 --> 58:07.640
By the way,

58:08.680 --> 58:09.900
that spirit you drove away...

58:09.940 --> 58:12.040
Was he Khem's karmic enemy?

58:12.960 --> 58:13.760
No.

58:16.120 --> 58:17.000
Now,

58:17.760 --> 58:19.440
remember those frenzied spirits?

58:21.040 --> 58:23.120
His true karmic enemy

58:23.160 --> 58:25.760
has the power to control them all.

58:32.560 --> 58:33.560
It's gone this far,

58:34.180 --> 58:35.440
and you still want to help him?

58:41.400 --> 58:42.320
Yes.

58:43.440 --> 58:45.040
I stand by my words.

58:48.520 --> 58:49.920
Please help him, Master.

58:52.040 --> 58:53.040
If you don't,

58:53.740 --> 58:55.160
I'm leaking your number.

59:10.400 --> 59:12.400
I won't promise I can save him.

59:16.720 --> 59:18.320
You'd better go keep him safe.

59:22.880 --> 59:24.280
The night's far from over.

59:39.920 --> 59:41.920
Master seems to care about Khem, though.

59:43.080 --> 59:44.560
Didn't he say he wouldn't...

59:46.280 --> 59:48.000
We'd better be ready, too.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:31.600
(Chanting)

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.080
Be careful.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.280
Don't worry.

01:00:58.840 --> 01:00:59.840
He's on his way.

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:01.480
- He's here.
- That's him.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:02.600
Here he is.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:03.960
- Hey.
- Mister.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:04.880
Is everyone here?

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.160
- Yeah, Mister.
- Yes.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.120
- Let's go.
- Okay.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:08.320
- Alright.
- Go.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.120
Everyone, are you ready?

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.120
- Yes.
- We are.

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:19.880
Let's do it.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.920
They're here.

01:01:53.990 --> 01:02:11.390
(Incanting)

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.760
Are you looking for me?

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.380
What has he done to you?

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:17.760
Can't you just let him go?

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:21.200
I shall never let him go.

01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:22.660
This is Charn,

01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:23.680
also a junior.

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:24.480
This is Jet,

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:25.520
my best friend.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.160
We've gone through this bamboo grove
over and over.

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:34.900
My duty

01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:36.600
is to take care
of the people in this village.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:41.040
I'll do whatever it takes
to stop being an outsider in your eyes.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:47.720

you still have me♫

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:52.800
