or think it's too ordinary,

340
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,020
you can give it back to me.

341
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,270
I love it so much.

342
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,240
You must have noticed that
my phone case was broken,

343
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,820
so you prepared this for me, right?

344
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,020
Your birthday is coming up,

345
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,820
and I didn't know what to get you.

346
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,070
Compared to the gift you gave me,

347
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,110
this is really nothing special.

348
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,380
Who says that?

349
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,530
You always give me exactly what I need.

350
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,920
Thank you.

351
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,080
Hi, Xiaoyang.

352
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,100
Are you guys done?

353
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,040
Tian Xinhui wants
to throw an early birthday party for Tuo.

354
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,290
You must come,

355
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,940
or I'll

356
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,200
kidnap Xiaoyang
and never give her back to you.

357
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,930
Right, we'll kidnap Xiaoyang.

358
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,260
Fine by me.

359
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,630
Cut it out.

360
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,290
Okay, I'll send you the location.

361
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,630
Be there or be square.

362
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,310
Let's go.

Cheers!

366

Buying a gift turned into a whole drama.

367
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,530
No, more like a drama for us.

368
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,470
Exactly.

369
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,560
It was just buying a computer.

370
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,190
Why go work at an investigation agency?

371
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,740
If you're short on money,
we could all chip in.

372
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,140
It only means something
if I earn it myself.

373
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,130
Let me see it.

374
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,750
No way.

375
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,060
So stingy.

376
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,770
Why does it have a dinosaur pattern?

377
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,960
Because Tuo...

378
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,330
It's a secret.

379
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,320
Forget it then. We have our secrets too.

380
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,250

We've toasted so many times already.

I don't care.

The one I used to like

392
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,010
was you.

393
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,980
Are you sure Junxi will take this route?

394
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,070
Of course.

395
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,210
This is the only route back
from the welfare store.

396
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,010
Have you decided how to confess?

397
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,420
I'll stop him

398
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,700
and invite him to the gaming expo.

399
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,890
I'll find a chance to confess by then.

400
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,380
He's coming. He's coming.

401
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,830
If you take another step,

402
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,360
I'll lose my chance at love.

403
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,220
In high school,

404
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,750
you confessed to me.

405
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,620
It was all fake.

406
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,950
Tian Xinhui, shut up.

407
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,860
Why are you being so harsh?

408
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,530
What's with that attitude?

409
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,300
You owe me this.

410
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,660
I wanted to confess to Junxi,

411
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,380
but you got in my way

412
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,190
and said you wanted to date me.

413
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,480
You didn't even like me!

414
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,530
You just didn't want

415
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,060
me to pursue Junxi.

416

I saw a pair of shoes at the entrance
