1
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,840
20 July 1969

2
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,480
5...4...3...2...1...0

3
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,710
All engines running. Lift-off. We have a lift-off,

4
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,400
at 32 minutes past the hour. Lift-off on Apollo 11.

5
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,590
Check if everything is okay.

6
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:23,590
Yes, sir.

7
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,760
Ladies and Gentlemen,

8
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,800
This is the night we shine!

9
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,800
But no one shines brighter than our host, Moira!

10
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,280
Welcome you all to...

11
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,550
Grand Paradiso!

12
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,320
Now comes the historic moment!

13
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,070
On its own now, but with Columbia near at hand,

14
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,280
it coasted around to the back side of the Moon,

15
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,150
and there, while out of direct communication with the Earth,

16
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,590
it fired its engine to slow its descent

17
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,030
to a touchdown on the near side of the Moon.

18
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,400
Collins in Columbia continued in orbit, awaiting their return.

19
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,150
Okay, I'm going to leave that one foot up there

20
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,710
and both hands down to about the fourth rung up.

21
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,320
There you go.

22
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,710
That's one small step for man

23
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,630
One giant leap for mankind

24
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:35,840
Ladies and Gentlemen,

25
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,840
Neil Armstrong just said...

26
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,280
That's one small step for man

27
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,840
One giant leap for mankind

28
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,760
That's one small step for a man

29
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,440
One giant leap...

30
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,480
for mankind.

31
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,280
For those not planning a trip to the moon anytime soon...

32
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,110
We Moonshine

33
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,000
got this song for you.

34
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,760
Excuse me, Ms. Moira,

35
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,760
That gentleman who's talking to M.L. Tanakom

36
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,070
Who is he?

37
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,360
A friend from the time when he was in England?

38
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,960
That's Dr. Trin Suwannapas.

39
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,800
Colonel Krailert's nephew.

40
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,230
Voilà! The heartthrob from Paris.

41
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,920
Is he that famous?

42
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,960
Tanwa? Moonshine's lead singer?

43
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,070
Yeah, you bet.

44
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,710
Do you know who his father is?

45
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,070
Padoem Chatbodi.

46
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,230
You sure?

47
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,960
Of course.

48
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,510
Father and son damn hate each other's guts.

49
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,520
I'm leaving now.

50
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,640
got an appointment with the higher-ups.

51
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,310
Hey Trin, I still haven’t shown you all the cuties yet.

52
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,230
I'm so sorry, sir.

53
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,760
Hey there!

54
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,190
Boy!

55
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,960
Could you shine my shoes quickly? I’m in a bit of a rush.

56
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,070
I’ll tip you big—promise.

57
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,110
Skip the ribbon—and scrub harder up front.

58
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,430
Yes, right there.

59
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,430
I'm so fucking ready.

60
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,960
Wait. We need a signal from Victor.

61
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,190
Don't rush it—we’ll just screw up the plan.

62
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,350
Okay, bro.

63
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,560
Here.

64
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,310
Thanks a lot.

65
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,070
Thank you, bro.

66
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,960
Trin.

67
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,310
Good evening, sir.

68
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,310
Oh, now we have to call you Dr. Trin.

69
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,960
It's been so many years.

70
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,960
Since the Deputy Secretary-General of

71
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,520
the National Economic and Social Development Council

72
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,350
is not here yet.

73
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,430
let me tell you frankly.

74
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,640
My boss, the Governor of Bank of Thailand,

75
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,270
would kill to have you on board.

76
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,190
Just think about it—being the governor’s assistant

77
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,310
is a big deal

78
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,270
That role puts you on the right track

79
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,760
to becoming the Bank of Thailand Governor yourself.

80
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,000
Thank you, sir.

81
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,270
Good evening, Mr. Deputy Secretary-General.

82
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,350
Good evening.

83
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,390
How are you doing, Tanat?

84
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,680
You’ve really been thriving at the BOT, huh?

85
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,430
I’m deeply grateful—I genuinely owe this to you.

86
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,270
I learned a lot from my time at NESDC.

87
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,720
No matter where you are,

88
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,640
you can still make a difference for the country.

89
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,560
Dr. Trin,

90
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:08,880
in your application,

91
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,840
you said you want to join

92
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,390
the National Economic and Social Development Council.

93
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,520
Yes, sir.

94
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,520
The reason why I invited you and Tanat today

95
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,600
to our informal meeting is to make sure

96
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,680
it’s clear that the BOT Governor’s assistant role

97
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,470
is not one that’s offered to just anyone.

98
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,720
I understand if you want to change your mind

99
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,800
or go back home and think it through.

100
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,390
I won't change my mind.

101
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,470
Trin, having a second thought is not a bad idea.

102
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,840
I did make a decision, really.

103
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,390
I want to join the NESDC.

104
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,760
I want to apply the knowledge and experience I gained abroad

105
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,110
to contribute to the betterment of this country,

106
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,560
just as I always hope for.

107
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,110
Hey, Victor's here.

108
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,110
They have landed on the moon.

109
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,800
That's fucking more exciting than the election.

110
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,150
Look at those guys waving guns and grabbing cash—

111
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,390
so hyped about the moon landing,

112
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
they fucking forgot millions

113
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,600
are still out here barefoot in the dirt.

114
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,390
Rallying the crew now. We’re marching to the hotel.

115
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,310
Victor, grab these posters and flyers—

116
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,350
start spreading them now. I’ll stall the cops.

117
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,800
You take care.

118
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,680
Don't get yourself arrested.

119
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,430
We just need enough noise to hit the headlines.

120
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,880
Don’t let them pin anything on you.

121
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:10,520
Let's go.

122
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:11,840
Let's go.

123
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,230
Hurry.

124
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,920
Steer clear of Huay Kam Saeng!

125
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,640
Just stay obsessed with flying to the moon!

126
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,070
Return the land! To the hands of the people!

127
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,110
No to capitalists! No to investors!

128
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,350
Return the land! To the hands of the people!

129
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,800
No to capitalists! No to investors!

130
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,150
Return the land! To the hands of the people!

131
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,720
Have the driver pick him up at the rear of the hotel.

132
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,760
Make sure they’re gone before the guests step outside.

133
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,840
Be careful—reporters' lurking.

134
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,920
Yes, sir.

135
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,560
There are protesters outside, sir.

136
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,470
You'd better leave now. I'll handle it from here.

137
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,560
Sounds good.

138
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,520
Colonel, speak with Mr. Padoem—

139
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,110
stick to what we agreed on.

140
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,600
The boss said no negotiations.

141
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,000
Yes, sir.

142
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,640
They are just a bunch of cattle;

143
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,000
let them meet the butcher, and they'll be tamed

144
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,190
and for the stubborn ones,

145
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,430
you just send them to the slaughterhouse.

146
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,960
I hope you can come in as soon as you can.

147
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,470
Just start preparing for the job.

148
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,000
Oh, Colonel. Good evening!

149
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,270
I'm beyond impressed with your nephew.

150
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,230
In the end he chose us over the BOT.

151
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,000
Trin always makes a good call.

152
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,190
A forward-thinking man like him

153
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,800
can get worn down by bureaucracy.

154
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,960
Most don’t last long.

155
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,640
We’d be glad to have you with us for the long term.

156
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,520
So, about the army’s land,

157
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,110
the students are protesting—what exactly is going on there?

158
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,720
It's just a misunderstanding.

159
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,030
I'll get going.

160
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:52,840
See you later.

161
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:01,800
Trin

162
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,270
The driver will pick you up at the back. Go home first.

163
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,390
I have another appointment with someone important.

164
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,920
I can head back on my own.

165
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,310
Just feel like taking a walk around the city.

166
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,000
Since coming back from France, I haven’t really seen

167
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,560
what Bangkok’s been up to lately, uncle.

168
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,720
Okay. Be careful.

169
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:18,760
Uncle

170
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,150
Shouldn't we find another way

171
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,070
to communicate to the students?

172
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,840
This project will benefit all parties.

173
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,470
The Public Relations Department's General Director

174
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,800
is Tanakom's boss.

175
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,880
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

176
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,110
No power plants in Huay Kam Saeng!

177
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,430
No dams!

178
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,960
I'm just taking a picture.

179
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,520
No dams!

180
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,640
No capitalists!

181
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,680
No power plants!

182
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,720
No investors! Return the land to the people!

183
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,000
No power plants!

184
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,000
No capitalists!

185
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,030
Hey!

186
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,430
Cowards!

187
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,470
You bunch of cronies!

188
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,390
what have you ever actually done for the people?

189
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,230
Don't go. It's dangerous.

190
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,560
Come with me if you're worried.

191
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,390
You know my situation.

192
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,840
You're a real coward.

193
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,560
Claire, please.

194
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,190
You know what?

195
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,110
I really hope you pay back the government

196
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,110
for every single baht they invested in you.

197
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,880
If one day, the same thing happens to your country,

198
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,470
I hope you’ll stand up for your people.

199
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,350
You don’t have to fight for me.

200
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,030
Boss

201
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,190
How it's going?

202
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,070
Nothing to worry about.

203
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,270
The students are just holding up some banners.

204
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,760
Still, the press got plenty of shots.

205
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,760
Tomorrow, every headline

206
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,270
will cover only the moon landing.

207
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:04,880
Sir

208
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,520
Today is your wedding anniversary.

209
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:12,640
Handle it for me, will you?

210
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:16,680
Get roses this time. Deliver them straight to my wife.

211
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,560
I'll drive myself home.

212
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,350
Yes, sir.

213
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,350
The contract, sir.

214
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,350
Thanks.

215
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,310
No power plants! Return the land to the people!

216
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,390
Please share what’s happening in Hauy Kam Saeng.

217
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,070
Hey, Sarge—

218
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,560
there's a protest at Grand Paradiso.

219
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,150
You need to move, now.

220
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,030
Hurry!

221
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,880
You've got a nice piano at home,

222
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,920
but you chose to keep playing here.

223
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,720
It just feels nicer here.

224
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,000
All credits to the hotel owner.

225
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,960
Perhaps you could make your home

226
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,150
a bit more welcoming, Colonel.

227
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,110
Mr. Padoem is going to the cigar room.

228
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,150
Thank you, Moira.

229
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,070
How many do you want?

230
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,150
Just a bag, auntie.

231
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,430
One bag? How about two? I give you one for free.

232
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,430
Okay, two bags. But let me pay.

233
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,230
Save them for the students.

234
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,800
Are you from around here?

235
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,470
I used to go to school nearby.

236
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,030
Back then, I'd sneak out

237
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,430
to grab snacks from you all the time.

238
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,390
You'd always slipped me a little extra,

239
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,190
afraid I wouldn’t have enough to feel full.

240
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,190
I’m way too old to remember something like that.

241
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,110
But look, I've got myself a really handsome customer!

242
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,720
Another handsome face. How many do you want?

243
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,920
I'll have what he's having.

244
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,110
How much is it per bag now, auntie?

245
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,960
One baht, dear.

246
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,680
Two baht for extra size.

247
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,680
One baht?

248
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,680
That's three times than what I used to pay.

249
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,880
It was only a quarter back then.

250
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,840
Everything’s getting more expensive these days—

251
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,470
I’ve got to raise my prices too.

252
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,000
It’s the only way I can stay afloat.

253
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,800
That reminds me—where’ve you been all this time?

254
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,150
I've been away for nine years and just came back.

255
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,760
I see.

256
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,230
Here you are.

257
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,960
Alright, auntie, I’ll get going now. I’ll drop by often.

258
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,880
Okay. See you again soon.

259
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,800
Two bags for you, right?

260
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,390
Here.

261
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,430
I'm full now. You can keep them to sell later, okay?

262
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,470
(Huay Kam Saeng says no to the Army. No capitalists.)

263
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,110
Can I have one?

264
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,350
It's you.

265
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,960
Did you shine my shoes earlier?

266
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,920
What do you want it for?

267
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,390
How well do you know about this?

268
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,470
I know enough to see it’s their home—

269
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,960
the land that gave them life.

270
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:48,190
long before the idea of ‘land titles’ even existed.

271
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,150
You do realize it’s a risky area—

272
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,230
full of thieves

273
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,190
and Mafia.

274
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,230
The land is too poor to farm.

275
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
All the state wants is to develop it

276
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
into something sustainable for the future.

277
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,430
Are you the army's spokeperson?

278
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:08,310
They arrested Keng! Hurry! Let's go!

279
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,680
Give this to your boss.

280
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:11,920
Stop!

281
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,110
Stop right there!

282
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,000
Don't you think that's too much, Colonel?

283
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,470
Which part do you think is too much, Mr. Padoem?

284
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,110
The part that says my company has to invest

285
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,720
in developing the surrounding area

286
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,800
which has nothing to do with the power plants.

287
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:12,920
Noted.

288
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:16,800
Colonel.

289
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,310
Yes?

290
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,920
Please sit down.

291
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,270
We haven’t even begun negotiations.

292
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,840
I’m only here to deliver the documents.

293
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,310
All I need is a yes or no from you,

294
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,190
so I can pass it along to General Pracha.

295
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,840
I didn't say no.

296
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,800
I’m simply voicing my concerns—as an equal partner.

297
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,640
A partner?

298
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,150
The Huay Kam Saeng power plant project was my idea.

299
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,030
I’m the one who invested—

300
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,920
my money, my people, my resources.

301
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,230
The project wouldn't exist without me.

302
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,270
Certainly.

303
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,270
This project was born from your vision

304
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,960
and dedication, Mr. Padoem.

305
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:16,150
And because the army believed you deserved the chance.

306
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,390
But the land belongs to the army.

307
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,720
The concession wasn't granted through open competition

308
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,000
but through selection.

309
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,920
Your company was selected because it was the fittest.

310
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,390
Sometimes...

311
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:47,470
you have to lose the battle to win the war.

312
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,800
Aunt Dhevi.

313
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,030
Have you eaten?

314
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,230
I had my fill at the reception.

315
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,030
looks like I need to skip dinner tonight.

316
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,840
I took a walk around my old school.

317
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,680
I bought you some fried dough balls.

318
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,880
This auntie sells the best dough balls in the world.

319
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,520
They look yummy.

320
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,680
How was your meeting with the Deputy Secretary-General?

321
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:54,030
All set. I start next week.

322
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,880
I'm happy for you.

323
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,070
Uncle Krailert didn't come back with you?

324
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,390
He said he had a meeting with someone important.

325
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,760
I see.

326
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,920
A bouquet from the Colonel, ma'am. For the anniversary.

327
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,310
Purple tulips.

328
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,880
Very pretty.

329
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,840
They are my favorite flowers, Veera.

330
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,270
Thank you.

331
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:41,110
(Happy Anniversary, Love, from Krailert)

332
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,680
At least

333
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,030
even if he's always buried in work

334
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:50,960
your uncle still remember I love purple tulips.

335
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,520
They are beautiful. They suit you.

336
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,760
I like them too.

337
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,520
Aunt Dhevi,

338
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,070
The food they served at the reception was so bland.

339
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,960
Maybe tonight,

340
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,640
I'll have to rely on your cooking.

341
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,470
Of course!

342
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,720
Let's have dinner.

343
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,960
Bring the dough balls too.

344
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,920
I made your favorite dish today, see?

345
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,640
All day and night we work without rest

346
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,150
We hold our heads high, doing our best

347
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,110
When evening comes, we let ourselves play

348
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,350
And when it’s night, we dance the night away

349
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,430
We smile with joy, hearts open wide

350
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,150
We are proud women, with nothing to hide

351
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,840
Mom, you’re so loud they can hear you

352
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,720
all the way down the alley!

353
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,560
Who’s got a problem with my singing, huh?

354
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,270
Hey—watch the knife!

355
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,520
I’ll tear your guts out.

356
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,000
What, you’re not enjoying my free concert?

357
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,800
Thank you, Nuch.

358
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,720
I'll take it from here.

359
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,190
You'd better go home.

360
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,880
No need.

361
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:31,920
If you want to help, go wash your hands first.

362
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,640
How am I supposed to know

363
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,640
where your hands have been all day?

364
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:36,520
If my customers got diarrhea,

365
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:37,800
Hey!

366
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,070
I’ll scold you so hard you’ll feel it in your next life.

367
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,430
I know.

368
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,270
What’s got you all grinning and singing like that?

369
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,030
A new customer complimented her today.

370
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,760
Aha!

371
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,680
- What did that guy say? / - Cutie Auntie?

372
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,640
"Your periwinkle curry is tasty"

373
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,600
Come on, Nuch—how can you be so dense?

374
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,640
Periwinkle refers to me,

375
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,760
and tasty means pretty.

376
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,880
That fella can’t say anything without slipping in a little jab.

377
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,000
You’re not married to a writer like me.

378
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,110
You wouldn't understand.

379
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,720
Hey, how long are you gonna keep laughing?

380
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,390
Go away if you're not helping.

381
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,920
Help's coming right up.

382
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,680
I'll give you a hand.

383
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,070
Mom

384
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,230
I've got a lot of tips today.

385
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,840
Just give me half. You can keep the rest and go.

386
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:49,070
If you have to stay up late tonight to study,

387
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:52,190
don't wake up early tomorrow. Nuch can give me a hand.

388
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,800
Hey, I wanna sleep in too!

389
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,640
Says someone who has work to do!

390
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,760
Otherwise just drag your lazy ass to school.

391
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,310
See you at four then, auntie.

392
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,110
Uh-huh

393
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,680
Victor

394
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,680
Victor

395
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,720
Victor

396
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,190
Yes, dad.

397
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,880
Take this to the Reverend at the church.

398
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,560
seems like there are more eulogies to write these days.

399
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,880
A step mistaken

400
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,070
Not everyone will take a great leap

401
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,310
On the day the world is celebrating

402
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,840
there are still many

403
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,430
who live with poverty,

404
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,470
fatigue,

405
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,720
and loneliness—

406
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,720
like the far side of the moon:

407
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,470
the side without reflection,

408
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,000
the side unseen.

409
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,840
Yet the near side, glowing bright,

410
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,640
may not tell the whole truth.

411
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,520
The hidden face, the one we overlook,

412
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,600
may hold a secret someone knows

413
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,760
but never dares to speak—

414
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,390
just like us,

415
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,760
just like them,

416
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,230
trapped in the shadow,

417
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,000
unable to break free.

418
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:55,270
But how long can we pretend to be outsiders,

419
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,470
when sooner or later,

420
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:03,230
we must choose a side to stand on?

421
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,720
Claire, your apartment is amazing!

422
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,350
But I'd prefer having a dad

423
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,070
who bought me something this cool.

424
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,000
They look wonderful together. Those two.

425
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,560
It's a pity you're leaving soon.

426
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,560
There’s a whole list of things

427
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,310
we were supposed to do together.

428
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:51,310
Oh baby.

429
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,350
He cannot stay. Duty calls—

430
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,840
he must return to serve his country

431
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:00,070
He's a scholarship student.

432
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,270
Wanna go out dancing?

433
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:08,800
Okay? Let's go dancing. Now!

434
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,430
Wanna race?

435
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,920
(giggle)

436
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,920
Marry me.

437
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,430
Why did you bring me here?

438
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:34,000
Didn't you say you wanted to meet the Director-General?

439
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,960
Yeah...

440
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,600
Exactly! That's why

441
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,070
But here? Are you serious, punk?

442
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,920
Mr. Trin, you're underestimating me and my boss.

443
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,350
Oh,

444
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,760
Tanakom!

445
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,230
Come on in!

446
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,920
They're here, Sucha?

447
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,230
Since the afternoon.

448
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,560
Come on in, Dr. Trin.

449
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,640
Welcome Dr. Trin!

450
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,390
That's the Director-General, AKA my boss.

451
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,880
He was our senior back in school.

452
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:34,920
Hey Tanakom!

453
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,560
This way!

454
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:38,880
Sir...

455
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,190
This is a friend of mine—we were classmates.

456
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,070
He was also in the same house as me back in school.

457
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,520
Really?

458
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,680
That makes him our housemate.

459
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,230
Come take a dip!

460
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,520
Sucha, pour me some booze.

461
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,470
Dude.

462
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:04,470
Consider my job's done.

463
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,070
I'm leaving, okay?

464
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,640
Take it off.

465
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:28,760
Your jacket—go on, take it off

466
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:43,030
Leave it there. Don’t worry, no one’s after what’s yours.

467
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,190
Now the socks. The shoes.

468
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:01,070
Roll up your sleeves...the trousers too.

469
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,070
Or—

470
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,720
just strip down to you undies.

471
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:52,960
Messy business, this undressing, huh.

472
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:02,760
Much better.

473
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,720
Make youself comfy.

474
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,190
Welcome to the far side of the moon.

475
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,760
Cheers.

476
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,270
I'd like the press to publicize the other aspect

477
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,110
of the Huay Kam Saeng power plant project

478
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,270
so the people can see all sides of the issue.

479
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,190
The latter part you're reading

480
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:39,150
is my economic analysis

481
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:39,920
of the Huay Kam Saeng case.

482
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:45,880
Did Krailert ask to you come?

483
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:46,840
No, sir.

484
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:48,680
I ask Tanakom to set up this meeting with you.

485
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:50,350
My uncle doesn't know about it.

486
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:53,760
The documents look solid.

487
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,270
Thank you, sir.

488
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,270
But let me warn you—as your senior from school:

489
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:03,070
Spreading this kind of information

490
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:05,390
is way too risky.

491
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,030
This is Thailand,

492
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,350
not Europe or America.

493
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:13,720
If what you've written

494
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,920
crosses the wrong people,

495
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,640
even being Krailert's nephew won't protect you.

496
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,350
They can make you disappear—any time, anywhere.

497
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,070
That's why I came to see you.

498
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:32,960
I owe you my sincere thanks

499
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:38,150
Tanakom always says he’s lucky to have you as his boss—

500
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,760
because you’re direct,

501
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,150
and principled to the core.

502
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:45,920
Today, I’ve seen that for myself.

503
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:48,230
Uh-huh

504
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,310
You two are real busy kissing each other’s asses.

505
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:54,270
Alright.

506
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,430
I'll take care of it.

507
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,190
United in spirit, our brotherhood stands

508
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:08,720
Side by side, with ready hands

509
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:13,640
Unity our armor, faith our might

510
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,800
Bound as one, in shared light

511
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,470
United in spirit, our brotherhood stands

512
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:25,190
With common dreams and willing hands

513
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:28,560
Unity our armor, faith our might

514
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,560
Bound as one, our hearts held tight

515
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,760
Com'on guys. Let’s keep ‘em coming!

516
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:43,310
Sucha, top off our drinks!

517
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,470
I think he said

518
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,760
"a man"

519
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,270
not just "man."

520
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:17,390
I beg your pardon?

521
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:20,190
What Neil Armstrong said

522
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,880
when he landed on the moon.

523
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,310
He should've meant his own small step—

524
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,560
a man's step

525
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,600
that's "a man."

526
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,070
But I don’t think “man” was wrong either.

527
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:42,720
He could've meant

528
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:45,000
all of humanity—the entire human race.

529
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,920
Right.

530
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:57,190
Can we evaluate a man

531
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,600
without forcing him

532
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,840
to be a part of something?

533
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,230
You think we can really escape it—

534
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:12,880
the fact that we have to belong to something?

535
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:15,350
Sure.

536
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,110
Have you tried?

537
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,070
No, thanks.

538
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:29,680
You’ve never run from anything?

539
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,600
How about you?

540
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:37,560
I lost count.

541
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:39,230
Did you succeed?

542
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,190
I don't know.

543
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:43,600
I don't care.

544
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,470
If you want to escape it all.

545
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:52,110
You'd have to fly to the moon.

546
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,150
You still won't make it.

547
00:49:57,390 --> 00:49:58,920
There's a rabbit.

548
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,030
There's a rabbit on the moon?

549
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:09,030
That's a good one.

550
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,760
What are you writing?

551
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:24,920
A man wants to escape from the Earth.

552
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,270
He sneaks onto Apollo 11,

553
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:33,150
and flies to the moon

554
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:34,880
hoping that

555
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:38,840
when Neil and the other guys

556
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:41,310
return to the Earth,

557
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:47,520
he’ll be all alone up there forever.

558
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,390
But the problem is...

559
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,560
The problem is...

560
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:58,350
There's a rabbit.

561
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,560
What does he do then?

562
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:10,000
He lets the bunny out.

563
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,310
Wh..

564
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:16,960
You know, he has to take a hare-raising leak.

565
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:22,350
Not funny?

566
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,720
Tinkle in the burrow.

567
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:37,600
Nice to meet you.

568
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,030
I'm Tanwa.

569
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,720
Nice to meet you.

570
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:55,390
I'm Trin.

571
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:25,390
Tinkle in the burrow.

572
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,640
My response to Sarasawadee:

573
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,230
First, your critique

574
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:42,150
on the song 'The Far Side of the Moon'

575
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:44,150
by Moonshine

576
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:46,800
is unexpectedly fresh.

577
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,720
I praise you with all my heart.

578
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:52,560
Next,

579
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,350
that very freshness leaves us, the readers, wondering

580
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,030
if you might still be of tender age—

581
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,230
too young to have tasted the world.

582
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,110
'The Far Side of the Moon'

583
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:15,560
speaks of things we haven't fully grasp,

584
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:18,310
things we may never know,

585
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,030
unless we find the courage

586
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:24,000
to step away from the bright side.

587
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:32,680
Ignorance will always be a gateway to the abyss—

588
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,600
but more frightening still,

589
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:38,000
is the stubbornness to see only what one wishes to see.

590
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,430
I'm bleeding.

591
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:45,270
Why?

592
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:47,430
That comment cuts deep!

593
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,840
(My response to Klai Rung)

594
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:05,270
In the end you still don't see, even though it's painfully obvious.

595
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,680
Lastly,

596
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:14,430
If you're so sure Klai Rung was in the wrong,

597
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:15,800
and you are so sure you're right,

598
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,000
go back and read the song's title.

599
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:23,720
If you still can't grasp the bright side of this issue,

600
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:26,350
Please contact Moonshine.

601
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,520
and ask them to change the song title to:

602
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:30,520
'The Dark Side of the Moon'

603
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:32,350
May that bring you peace.

604
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:37,600
(Klai Rung)

605
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:41,520
Nothing remains the same.

606
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,310
Shit...
