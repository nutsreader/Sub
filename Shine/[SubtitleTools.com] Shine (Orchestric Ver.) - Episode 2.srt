1
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,200
1960, 9 years ago

2
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,120
You’re amazing at this.

3
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,159
I had a pretty incredible instructor.

4
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,719
I'm getting dressed first.

5
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,400
Um.

6
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,599
Come here.

7
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,240
Win, you go first.

8
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,000
I'll be leaving in an hour.

9
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,719
Can I have this?

10
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,879
What if someone saw it,

11
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,719
it'd be a scandal for you.

12
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:07,919
Lert

13
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,319
If, one day I quitted acting

14
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,280
what would you say?

15
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,360
You mean

16
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,719
quit being a movie star?

17
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,360
Yeah.

18
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,560
I'm starting to realize this isn't the life I want.

19
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,599
I want to live like normal people...

20
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,759
owning a house by the water,

21
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,400
a dog—

22
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,800
two, may be three...

23
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:45,520
I don't think you'll stop at three.

24
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,280
Come live with me, Lert.

25
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,280
I'm right here with you now, aren't I?

26
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,840
You know what I mean.

27
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,199
Win, are you serious?

28
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,639
I'm serious—

29
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,800
because of you.

30
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,560
Win,

31
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,079
this isn't possible.

32
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,519
We have to live in the real world.

33
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,959
You're a movie star.

34
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,120
Everyone knows your name.

35
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,720
Then we’ll go somewhere no one does.

36
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,040
I’d give it all up for you, Lert.

37
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,480
I just want you with me.

38
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,800
That's okay, Lert.

39
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,839
Maybe it's too soon for this conversation.

40
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,959
I'm sorry if I make you feel...

41
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,879
No, don't apologize.

42
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,439
I can wait for you, always.

43
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,879
Sit down, Lert.

44
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,480
"7 Days, No Sight of Asawin Wiswa —

45
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,160
Where Has the Star Gone?"

46
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,240
You must understand what's worth keeping

47
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,720
and what must be sacrificed

48
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,800
for the greater goal.

49
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,120
Don't let anything—or anyone—distract you.

50
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,920
I have this one remade.

51
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,560
It suits you better.

52
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,519
I never bet on the wrong guys.

53
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,079
People like you two, Pracha and Lert—

54
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,160
You both stand out,

55
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,040
and have the potential to rise,

56
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,800
maybe even reach where I am someday.

57
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,800
And for you Lert, there's another thing.

58
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,279
I want you to marry my daughter, Dhevi.

59
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,279
Sometimes, love is born in the brief flutter of a glance

60
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,199
—that fleeting moment when eyes meet.

61
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,279
And once they do, they can never look away.

62
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:26,199
1969, the present

63
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:28,959
When Klai Rung said that being attracted to someone

64
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,199
is nothing more than a fleeting infatuation,

65
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,159
perhaps he hadn’t yet grasped

66
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,080
the true weight of that emotion.

67
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,000
This song is telling us—

68
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,679
it reminds us that the courage to confront our feelings

69
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,960
can give us a chance at first love,

70
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,399
a path toward true love—

71
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,879
something far deeper than any love we only dare to imagine.

72
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,519
Some people shine when battling a blank page,

73
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,879
but never find the strength

74
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,480
to step beyond the shadow of themselves,

75
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,399
to face the world as it is.

76
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,440
We must have the audacity to take a risk,

77
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,759
to leave behind the safety of our familiar playgrounds,

78
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,519
and stop merely playing it safe.

79
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,679
So I, Sarasawadee,

80
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,559
am asking the readers—

81
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,200
especially you, Klai Rung;

82
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,720
"Are you that kind of person?"

83
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,240
Dear readers,

84
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,000
a rush without direction is not courage—

85
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,240
it is merely the fervor

86
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,000
of those unaware of where they are going.

87
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:36,879
But perhaps I am mistaken.

88
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,639
So allow me this self-imposed exile—

89
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:43,360
to meet the last rays of Monday’s light

90
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,840
in the silent corner of Kitakarn,

91
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,799
where endless letters linger,

92
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,080
threatened to become nothing more than passing words.

93
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,919
There I will be, dressed in black,

94
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,399
mourning someone’s dark utterance.

95
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,879
And I wish—I wish that person

96
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:03,679
would find the courage to say aloud:

97
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,360
"How clueless, how ignorant I have been!"

98
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,600
And when the final sound of time resounds in that place,

99
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,360
then, and only then, shall we know—

100
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:18,759
whether the answer lies upon the page,

101
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,399
or somewhere far beyond.

102
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,919
What's that dude's deal?

103
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,879
This analysis is fantastic.

104
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,240
Complete, solid data.

105
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,559
Who wrote it?

106
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,320
Some researcher from NESDC.

107
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,679
Great. We could get statements from both sides.

108
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,759
I’ll digest it

109
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,000
and reference it in mine.

110
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,840
No.

111
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,960
We’re not using your crap.

112
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,639
Your job is to digest this article—and write a new one.

113
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,320
Hey!

114
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,360
What!

115
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,000
Last time,

116
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,600
your piece on the election

117
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,399
got Boon exiled to Japan.

118
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,000
And now you’re stirring up shit about the power plants?

119
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,960
Everyone’s buzzing about the moon landing.

120
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,840
Don’t kill the mood.

121
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,240
But when Boon was chief editor—

122
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,360
Do I look like Boon to you, punk?

123
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,120
These two are a perfect match,

124
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,200
Klai Rung and Sarasawadee.

125
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,120
Our sales have skyrocketed.

126
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,600
Readers are on edge,

127
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,960
dying for the moment the two finally give in to it.

128
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,960
Meanwhile, no one gives a damn

129
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,240
about our hard-earned political reports.

130
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,840
They never even make it past the chief editor.

131
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,639
Ran, did your piece get axed again?

132
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,200
Worse. I'm just typing out whatever they dictate to me.

133
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,440
Fuck.

134
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,840
Are we journalists, or just mouthpieces dodging reality?

135
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,919
Keep it down. The chief might hear.

136
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,480
Think about it.

137
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,840
I'm a political photographer,

138
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,320
and they sent me to take pictures of a banana tree

139
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,559
because it grew fruit from the middle of the trunk.

140
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,159
Fuck.

141
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,759
A political reporter like me has it worse.

142
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:10,279
I’m writing about a pig that gave birth to nine piglets.

143
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,519
What does that tell you?

144
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,720
That’s why readers consume nothing but crap.

145
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,080
No wonder readers are glued

146
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,919
to the 'Enveloped in Melody' column

147
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:21,960
Klai Rung wrote this paragraph like a poet.

148
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:23,759
What's he trying to say?

149
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,600
Look.

150
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,960
Here's another one.

151
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,399
"meet"

152
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:54,519
"Monday"

153
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,039
"dressed in black"

154
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,480
"I wish that person would find the courage to say aloud"

155
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:09,639
"How clueless, how ignorant I have been!"

156
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,679
"Kitakarn"

157
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,159
Kitakarn Library?

158
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,279
Have you ordered?

159
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,399
No. I was waiting for you.

160
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,879
Sorry. I had a problem with the chief.

161
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,480
You know, he's so god damn—

162
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,320
Naran, I don't want to hear this right now.

163
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,960
Okay. Fine.

164
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,200
That's it?

165
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,080
What now?

166
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,799
You know I'm not okay.

167
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,679
But you just said okay,

168
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,399
and picked up the menu?

169
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,320
So,

170
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,159
Dao, what do you want me to do?

171
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,399
I don't want the same old excuses.

172
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,080
I've heard them a thousand times.

173
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:33,840
Would you like to order?

174
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,399
No / Yes

175
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:40,200
Onion soup and tenderloin steak salad for the lady,

176
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,159
and roast pork rice for me.

177
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:43,919
Yes, sir.

178
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,000
How is it? Did I get your order right?

179
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,519
The food is fine.

180
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,120
But the rest isn't.

181
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,720
How long have we gone over this?

182
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,679
I love my job.

183
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:05,120
I wasn't born into a family of bankers like you, Dao.

184
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,639
Being a journalist is hard, but—

185
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,600
Forget it.

186
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,519
We haven't ordered drinks.

187
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,519
I’ll get you a beer.

188
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,279
Um.

189
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,480
(Echoes of Euphoria)

190
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,320
(Closed)

191
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,320
I—

192
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,920
I kissed—

193
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,039
No, no, no—

194
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,599
This doesn't feel normal.

195
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,960
No, no.

196
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,799
Cannabis.

197
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,480
Move your ass. Damn it!

198
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,480
What's wrong with you?

199
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,519
Didn't everything seem fine

200
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:01,079
with the Director-General?

201
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:03,920
Gosh...

202
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,119
Damn it.

203
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,359
What did I do wrong this time?

204
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,440
You ditched me!

205
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,279
You brought me there, then ran off with those chicks

206
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:17,680
never came back.

207
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,799
You ditched me. Screw you!

208
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:22,400
Trin.

209
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:24,759
I'm getting worried about you.

210
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,680
What the hell got into you?

211
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,359
Did someone do something to you?

212
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,519
No.

213
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,839
No one did anything to me.

214
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,519
I'm leaving.

215
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,200
Where to?

216
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,640
The swimming pool.

217
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,319
...Oh.

218
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,599
Got it.

219
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,440
Colonel.

220
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,319
Your question?

221
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,559
Colonel,

222
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:29,839
about the Huay Kam Saeng power plants—

223
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:31,599
the ones that affect local residents at the moment—

224
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:33,160
How do you plan to address the situation?

225
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,359
None of these projects

226
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,680
are meant to create problems.

227
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,519
They’re designed to solve them.

228
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,319
All relevant departments

229
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:43,079
are working closely with the community

230
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:45,359
to improve their livelihoods.

231
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,480
I urge you all to stay optimistic.

232
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,200
Sir !

233
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,599
May I ask a question ?

234
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,559
Please go ahead.

235
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,400
There are concerns the concession was rushed.

236
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,599
Some suspect conflicts of interest—

237
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:04,039
between the army

238
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:06,720
and a private company with close ties to high-ranking generals.

239
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,720
Can you confirm there's no hidden arrangement?

240
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,079
If the press had followed this project from the start,

241
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,480
you’d know we’ve worked on it for years.

242
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,839
We’ve assessed its profitability

243
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,079
and ensured transparency.

244
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,799
If you have credible evidence of misconduct,

245
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:31,920
file for an official investigation.

246
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,160
You'd better go all the way,

247
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,519
Otherwise, your accusations are nothing

248
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:38,119
but a baseless imagination.

249
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,119
Right?

250
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,000
Thank you, sir. We'll definitely go all the way.

251
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:17,400
That Siam Daily Mail reporter—

252
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,880
do you want me to shut him up?

253
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,680
What's his name?

254
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,000
Naran, sir.

255
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:24,960
No, not yet.

256
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,440
I'll give him another chance.

257
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,880
There won't be a next time.

258
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:33,400
Yes, sir.

259
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:36,680
Veera.

260
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,680
Yes?

261
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:40,400
I'll be working late tonight. Need to clear the backlog.

262
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,240
Alright, sir.

263
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:45,039
Does Amporn ever complain

264
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,559
about you getting home late?

265
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,319
No, sir, she doesn't.

266
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,400
When are you two getting married?

267
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,400
Not yet, sir.

268
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,960
You'll be promoted to captain soon.

269
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,079
Her parents won't object to you then.

270
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,039
Let me know when the wedding is.

271
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,960
I'll handle the dowry.

272
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,400
Thank you, sir.

273
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,400
Oh—sir.

274
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:13,400
This morning,

275
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,279
Ms. Dhevi complained her eyes were itching,

276
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:17,480
so I bought the usual eye drops for her.

277
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,319
Bring them to her then.

278
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:24,039
You can head home after that. I'll drive myself.

279
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,759
Yes, sir.

280
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,880
Naran—

281
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:40,839
Annoying as fuck

282
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,519
Whoa, you seriously made me jump!

283
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:51,960
Working late again, huh?

284
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,200
Not tonight.

285
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,079
Boss is driving himself for once.

286
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:57,079
Hey, let’s grab some drinks—same spot as usual.

287
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,720
Can’t. Got stuff to do.

288
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,559
Aww, come on...

289
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:01,160
Save the guilt trip for next time, will ya?

290
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,960
But loads of our classmates are showing up!

291
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,759
Yeah, well, I’ve actually got something important.

292
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,000
Fine. Then show up after you’re done.

293
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,759
You know everyone's been whining about you never showing up.

294
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:13,920
Just be there, alright? Don’t bail again.

295
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,519
Alright, alright. I’ll swing by when I’m done.

296
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:17,920
Get moving. Go!

297
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:19,079
Go!

298
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:20,480
Catch you later, buddy.

299
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,279
Phew...

300
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,000
Please excuse us, young master.

301
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,240
Young master your ass!

302
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:33,599
Cha!

303
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,640
Damn it! Cha!

304
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:40,319
Cha!

305
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,519
Cha!

306
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,279
Damn it!

307
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,359
Why the hell aren’t you dressed?

308
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,839
Don't you remember

309
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,200
what day it is?

310
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,440
I don't.

311
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:03,079
I'll go back in there and check the calendar for you.

312
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,160
Tanwa!

313
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,240
In one year,

314
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,640
I only ask for two days.

315
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,440
One—your mother’s death anniversary.

316
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:17,640
Two—the family merit-making day.

317
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,839
Just these two days.

318
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:23,279
Can’t you act like a normal human being?

319
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:25,480
And the rest,

320
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,359
you can live like a street dog all you want.

321
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,720
You're calling me a dog now?

322
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,799
Tanwa! Stop right there!

323
00:25:58,799 --> 00:25:59,599
Hey!

324
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,400
I'm telling you to stop!

325
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,480
Tanwa!

326
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:04,960
I said stop!

327
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:12,119
You want to reunite with your mom that much?

328
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,079
Sounds good!

329
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:16,599
How about now!

330
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,160
You're almost thirty.

331
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,759
Dropped out of school.

332
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,880
Nothing to your name.

333
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:32,359
Every day, you just burn through my money!

334
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,519
Is it your money?

335
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:39,119
Not really.

336
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,480
I'm using mom's money.

337
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:44,240
Her hard-earned money.

338
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,279
The only thing I borrowed from you,

339
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,720
and can never return

340
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,400
is your blood

341
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,279
and your surname.

342
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:07,400
I must apologize

343
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:14,680
for making you call your son a dog.

344
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,400
But let me be the dog that I am.

345
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,400
Hey!

346
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,680
Just let him go.

347
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,559
I know where he'll head to.

348
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:40,400
Yes, sir.

349
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,640
Kid...

350
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:26,240
Not a kid anymore.

351
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,519
You wanna try?

352
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,920
There is a room prepared for you.

353
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,319
Why didn’t you stay in your own room?

354
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,880
No, thanks.

355
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,799
Just that is good enough.

356
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:46,200
My hotel isn't a love motel.

357
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,000
Talking with Moira up here is way more fun.

358
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:01,160
I was meaning to ask you—

359
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,160
those things...

360
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:07,480
they seem like they don’t belong together.

361
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,480
They are my past.

362
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:14,319
I wore that crown

363
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,319
when I danced to welcome state guests.

364
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,079
I was sixteen.

365
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,839
My dancing was good enough to earn me a husband.

366
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,720
What about the one on the lower shelf?

367
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,359
That one?

368
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,160
It's called a betal nut case.

369
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:32,400
I bet you don’t even know what that is.

370
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,000
It belonged to my grandmother.

371
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:37,799
Funny thing—

372
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:39,720
After she passed,

373
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:42,440
my mother put it on a pedestral,

374
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,519
prayed to it like it was a sacred Buddha statue.

375
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,319
That's the most a minor wife can inherit.

376
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:58,000
You're not praying to it now?

377
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:02,880
Just displaying it. It gives off a sacred aura.

378
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:12,559
And that floral crown?

379
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,400
That one? My first husband—

380
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,759
the mine owner—had it made for me.

381
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,000
He said I was his queen.

382
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,680
And you know what?

383
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,799
When Henry, my third husband, found out,

384
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:28,279
he had a diamond tiara custom-made for me.

385
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:33,519
Any other crown you want, Moira?

386
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:57,200
Now, I'm a queen here.

387
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,400
I don't need anyone to give me a crown.

388
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,680
What's up?

389
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,880
I'm delivering your laundry, sir.

390
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:35,640
Bring the bill here.

391
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,079
What's your name?

392
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,920
Victor, ma'am.

393
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,079
Thank you, Victor.

394
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,319
Thank you, ma'am.

395
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,960
Wait.

396
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,839
Just a sec.

397
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:17,119
Thank you, sir.

398
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,759
Right...

399
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,799
That's why they call it motherfucker.

400
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:43,920
Excuse me.

401
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,960
Your eye drops, Ms. Dhevi.

402
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,000
Where's the colonel, Veera?

403
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,400
He's at work, ma'am.

404
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,400
He asked me to bring these to you.

405
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,480
The chemist mentioned that these drops

406
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,839
are only good for one month after being opened.

407
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:03,519
You’ll need a new bottle, even if this one isn’t finished.

408
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:06,759
Thank you.

409
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,720
May I change the water in the tulip vase?

410
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,119
The florist said

411
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,480
purple tulips aren’t as long-lasting as other colors.

412
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,319
You need to change the water often.

413
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,519
Adding a teapoon of sugar

414
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,400
and a teaspoon of vinegar to the water

415
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,680
should help extend their life.

416
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,839
Thank you, Veera.

417
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:54,319
Tanwa, play a long set tonight, alright?

418
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:58,480
Shall we start?

419
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,279
Let's go!

420
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,320
Hey Trin!

421
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:21,199
You owe me big time, man!

422
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,679
Why?

423
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:28,960
Because I'm your best buddy!

424
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,760
And... I happen to know you’re desperately deprived.

425
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,400
Deprived of what?

426
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,800
Dating, you need a date

427
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,760
But fret not.

428
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,320
That's all taken care of. By me!

429
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:44,880
But I didn’t a—

430
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,960
Here she comes!

431
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:00,400
This is Rose.

432
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:03,079
M.L. Rujiprapai, my cousin.

433
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:05,039
And this is...

434
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:07,119
Dr. Trin. I told you about him.

435
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,559
Good evening, Dr. Trin.

436
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,880
Good evening.

437
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,039
Please—

438
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,360
Please sit down.

439
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:29,079
Excuse me. Can we have two more wine glasses?

440
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,280
Uh...

441
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,000
Yes?

442
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,320
I have to excuse myself.

443
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,119
I need to be up early for work tomorrow.

444
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:05,880
It was nice meeting you, Rose.

445
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,079
I'll get going, Kom.

446
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,119
Thanks!

447
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,599
Trin!

448
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,440
Trin!

449
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,079
Oh, Tanwa.

450
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,320
Oh,

451
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,320
Trin.

452
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,039
What are you up to?

453
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,599
This. This is what I'm up to.

454
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,639
Why are you running from me?

455
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:07,800
Running from you? When did I run from you?

456
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,039
We just met, didn’t we?

457
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,599
We had met. This afternoon.

458
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:14,960
The elevator.

459
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,800
Oh.

460
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,480
Sorry. I'm short-sighted.

461
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:27,599
I can't see clearly.

462
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,280
I hardly remember anyone.

463
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,000
Why are you running?

464
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,880
Why are you running? Huh?

465
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,079
I'm asking you why you're running.

466
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:46,000
Sorry!

467
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,639
Was I high on cannabis?

468
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,960
No!

469
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,039
I wasn't high on cannabis.

470
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,400
(mouthing) Why are you running?

471
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:46,360
Take Rostow, an economist—

472
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,199
he proposed that

473
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,760
"the transition from an agrarian economy

474
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,440
to an industrialized one"

475
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,679
is the appropriate pathway toward economic prosperity

476
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:56,599
that could signifiantly alleviate poverty.

477
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,679
This framework serves as a foundational paradigm

478
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:00,079
for our national development.

479
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,599
We need to promote heavy industries

480
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,920
and invest in large-scale physical infrastructure

481
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,000
to support broad-based economic growth

482
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,320
and effectively reduce income

483
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,679
disparity and class stratification.

484
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:12,679
Anyone wants to share their thoughts?

485
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:19,480
I do.

486
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,800
Go ahead—

487
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:25,079
Mr....

488
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:27,280
Victor.

489
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:31,000
Yes, Mr. Victor.

490
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:38,079
Why do foreign-educated intellectuals

491
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,599
rely on Western theories to explain everyday life?

492
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,199
Do we really need an explanation

493
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:55,119
when we already understand the root of the problem?

494
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:58,440
We just lack the agency to change it.

495
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,079
You're right.

496
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:07,679
Anyone directly affected can see the issue with clarity.

497
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,639
But if you truly understand the problem,

498
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:13,639
why do you keep applying the same old approach

499
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,079
to achieve the same old results,

500
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:17,679
Mr. Victor?

501
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,440
We're still fighting

502
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,880
because the system sucks.

503
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:26,440
No—

504
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,159
We need reform from the ground up.

505
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:31,639
The economic system must serve all classes fairly.

506
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,480
And how exactly is protesting in the streets

507
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,800
going to solve the problem?

508
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:39,519
Without pressure from the grassroots—

509
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,519
do you really believe those in power would fix it?

510
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,199
But if we don’t address the systemic flaws at the root,

511
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:47,880
no matter how many protests we organize,

512
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,559
we’re only treating the symptoms, not curing the disease.

513
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:51,000
The problems will return.

514
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,039
And how many years will it take

515
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:53,599
for that systemic overhaul to materialize?

516
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:54,719
Ten?

517
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:55,880
Twenty?

518
00:44:56,599 --> 00:44:59,159
What are those from below supposed to do in the meantime?

519
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,440
Say, if someone doesn't want to

520
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,199
become a farmer like generations before,

521
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:04,199
are they supposed to wait

522
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:06,639
until things magically get better on their own?

523
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:12,320
We don’t have the power to shift the system.

524
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,960
So what?

525
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:16,639
So we're just gonna stay silent?

526
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:18,960
Why don't we go out and make our demands heard?

527
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,800
I like what you're doing.

528
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:36,639
This is the kind of thinking that could move the country forward.

529
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:39,639
Even though we’re still running in the maze today,

530
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:42,199
at least we haven’t stopped asking questions.

531
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,199
We haven’t stopped searching for answers.

532
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,280
And we refuse to stay ignorant about social issues.

533
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,119
I believe the most important thing you’ll gain from university

534
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,159
is learning how to find your own way out of that maze.

535
00:45:56,679 --> 00:45:59,679
It only matters inside this classroom, Prof.

536
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:11,719
Good bye.

537
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,400
Go ahead. I'll be there in a few minutes.

538
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,119
Alright. Come quickly.

539
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:23,960
Okay.

540
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,039
Student—aren’t you going to lunch?

541
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:35,679
Dr. Trin Suwannapas

542
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,199
That's one famous surname.

543
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,079
You don't seem to hide your dislike of me.

544
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,840
I think you’ve got me wrong.

545
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:51,079
Don't bother.

546
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,920
Your kind never looks below your eye level anyway.

547
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,480
Allow me to give you a personal lesson.

548
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:06,599
Please,

549
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:09,079
Professor.

550
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,079
I'm an economist,

551
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,159
But I don’t believe it’s fair

552
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:19,119
to judge people by their economic status.

553
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:21,679
You seem like a rational kid.

554
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:24,599
But don’t you think labeling the rich as bad,

555
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,280
the poor as good—

556
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,480
that’s just as unfair?

557
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:29,920
No.

558
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,760
But what can I do? This country isn’t fair to begin with.

559
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:36,639
Please excuse me.

560
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,239
Sorry.

561
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:44,159
I wasn’t paying close enough attention.

562
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:46,480
I’ll shine your shoes again—if I ever get the chance.

563
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,400
Where's Claire?

564
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,320
Where's Claire!?

565
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:18,840
She was killed.

566
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:23,280
She's dead.

567
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,280
What? How did it happen?

568
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,159
Why didn't you protect her?

569
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,039
How could this happen?

570
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:43,599
Wasn't she your girlfriend? It was your job to keep her safe!

571
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:48,199
Stop. Stop. We're leaving. We're leaving.

572
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:00,760
You're not the only one who lost her, okay?

573
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,400
(Kitakarn Library)

574
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:25,320
I have an appointment with someone.

575
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,760
The library is closing.

576
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:38,480
Hey.

577
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,800
Must I say it out loud?

578
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:43,239
Pardon?

579
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,440
How clueless,

580
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,559
how ignorant I have been!

581
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,239
Okay.

582
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,440
I'm sorry. I must leave.

583
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:36,239
when the final sound of time resounds in that place...

584
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,800
Am I too early?

585
00:52:07,239 --> 00:52:08,920
(Closed)

586
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,599
Why did I even come here?

587
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,639
What an idiot!

588
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,239
Wait!

589
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:06,199
So what now—kill me to shut me up?

590
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,039
I'll scream!

591
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:12,559
Not bad.

592
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:14,159
I’m impressed.

593
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,840
Sarasawadee is witty enough

594
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:19,320
to know that was a coded message for a meeting.

595
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:25,119
Sorry to break it to you,

596
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,880
but that's not the least bit witty.

597
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:30,119
As a matter of fact, It's too painfully obvious.

598
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:34,519
You're a powerful colonel.

599
00:54:35,719 --> 00:54:38,480
I expected something more creative from you.

600
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,360
This is my private library.

601
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,239
How convenient—

602
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,559
a secret place for a blind date.

603
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:53,199
Don't come any closer!

604
00:54:54,519 --> 00:54:56,280
Help! Help!

605
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,719
Help! Help!

606
00:54:57,719 --> 00:54:59,639
Stop! Saras—

607
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,280
Damn it. Why pick such a difficult name!

608
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:04,519
NARAN

609
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,199
I'm Klai Rung.

610
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:12,239
Pleased to meet you in person.

611
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:18,239
I'm,

612
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:22,280
SA-RA-SA-WA-DEE,

613
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,960
not pleased at all.

614
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,360
You sure?

615
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:31,679
Aha,

616
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,360
Sure!

617
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,320
Don't tease me.

618
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:37,239
I'm not teasing you.

619
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,320
Lyrics by...

620
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,840
Kasem Cheunpradit

621
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:45,039
Music by...

622
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,079
Saman Kanchanapalin

623
00:55:52,039 --> 00:55:52,880
Not bad.

624
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,239
Adapted from a Thai classical song—

625
00:55:55,239 --> 00:55:56,679
"Lingering on my mind," Moderato.

626
00:55:58,519 --> 00:55:59,639
I said it first.

627
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:04,280
Thought you're only into Western songs.

628
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:06,719
I'm Thai.

629
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:09,119
I'm a true patriot, sir.

630
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,599
Now let go of my hand.

631
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,760
No.

632
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:25,320
I said no.

633
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:31,599
Don't...

634
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,360
Mr. Klai Rung, I'm warning you.

635
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,920
And what are you going to do?
