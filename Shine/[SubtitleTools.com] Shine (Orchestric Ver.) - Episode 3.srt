1
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:08,000
Clouds never stand in anyone’s way.

2
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
All they ever do is drift.

3
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,360
But we often forget

4
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,039
we’re free to walk right through them.

5
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,000
Tanakom

6
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,360
I need your help with something.

7
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,919
Surprise!

8
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,520
Not really...

9
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,240
My friend said you're here to return my stuff.

10
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,080
Is it really that important?

11
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,759
Why make such a fuss?

12
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,199
Just give it to me.

13
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,159
I don’t use anything that’s touched the floor anyway.

14
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,879
You can have it.

15
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,719
Hey—how about something else?

16
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,479
You're not running away again, are you?

17
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,520
What’s your deal?

18
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,159
Alright, alright.

19
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,039
How about a race?

20
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,560
If I win,

21
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,719
you have to let us pick up where we left off.

22
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,520
Do you dare?

23
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,120
Didn’t you say we’d play tennis?

24
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,480
Who said that?

25
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,360
When did I ever agree to that?

26
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,959
If you're that scared to lose, we’ll just cancel.

27
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,480
Fine. Swimming it is.

28
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,199
Hey!

29
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,439
Hey!

30
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,160
-Go! / - Hey!

31
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,319
Hey!

32
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,000
Why the heck didn’t you swim?

33
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,879
Plain swimming's not cool enough.

34
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,800
Let’s see who can hold their breath the longest!

35
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,839
You're up first, Trin. I win!

36
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,399
You cheated! You startled me on purpose!

37
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,000
Like I care. You lost.

38
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,519
It's time to keep our promise.

39
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,120
Cheating breaks the whole deal, dork!

40
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,360
When you smile,

41
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,399
You're so damn cute.

42
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,879
I waited at the tennis court for hours.

43
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,120
Since when did you two get this close?

44
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,439
Dear readers,

45
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,759
When you look up and observe

46
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,000
the strands of white clouds in the sky,

47
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,000
what do you see?

48
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,319
A castle in the air—

49
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,279
woven from softness,

50
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:17,959
sprawling into a wild, endless range of white hills?

51
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,879
Or do you see a dark, looming wall,

52
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,600
one that blocks the warmth of the sun

53
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,040
and chokes the comfort out of light?

54
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,600
Let's have a baby

55
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
I'm sorry.

56
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,200
I've got a headache.

57
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,159
That cloud will only thicken into heavy,

58
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,919
pouring rain, or a pale, spectral snowstorm.

59
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,080
And at the first sign of falling drops, we already know

60
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,879
It’s not going to be a good day.

61
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,519
The lyrics of ‘Half of Everything’ by Nora Van

62
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:54,799
meditate on the irony of love—

63
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:58,039
how it shifts from dreamlike brilliance into hollow illusion.

64
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,639
And what about your love?

65
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:02,960
Is it a cotton-white cloud, or a dark, looming wall of threat?

66
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,759
You must’ve listened to the wrong song, Klai Rung.

67
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:13,639
Or maybe you only listened to half of it, just like the title says.

68
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,240
But ‘half of everything’

69
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,159
doesn’t mean you get to choose only one side.

70
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,200
White or dark, bright or brooding, it’s all just projection.

71
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,759
We see only what we choose to see.

72
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,519
And if love becomes a wall

73
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,559
standing between you and the future,

74
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:41,799
then maybe there’s no other choice but to tear it down.

75
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,320
A sky without clouds

76
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,080
might be unbearably hot—

77
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,159
but it still glows, and clearly shows the way forward.

78
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,840
Klai Rung, August 1969

79
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,639
What are you reading?

80
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,399
I could hear you laugh from out there.

81
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,360
Just a column.

82
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,720
Are you hungry? Want to head out?

83
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,399
It seems Klai Rung

84
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,879
should stop listening to that song for a while

85
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:38,720
and try to figure out what love truly means.

86
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,000
Only then can he come back and listen to it again.

87
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,360
Have you read what they wrote about you in the paper today?

88
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,720
What did they say?

89
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,639
Here.

90
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,240
"Colonel Krailert:

91
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,440
New Power Plants Confirmed to Have No Problems."

92
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,559
"The local residents' anxiety

93
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,399
was caused by a misunderstanding."

94
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,039
"The colonel challenged anyone suspecting misconduct

95
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,279
to file for investigation."

96
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,200
Looks like they’re trying to provoke you.

97
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,919
This Siam Daily Mail...

98
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,120
If my father were still here—

99
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,759
Don’t worry about it.

100
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,720
The journalists are just doing their job.

101
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,759
"Colonel Krailert:

102
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,399
New Power Plants Confirmed to Have No Problems."

103
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,600
The chief told you not to provoke him again.

104
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
We need to find a way to let people see

105
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,440
what the government is really doing to them.

106
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,679
They should know how disgustingly selfish the elites are.

107
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,919
All they care about is power and—

108
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,399
Hey,

109
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,120
just because someone’s born rich,

110
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,000
does that automatically make them

111
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,600
a villain to democrats like you?

112
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:34,799
I didn’t mean to blame you, Dao.

113
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,879
Right.

114
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,840
You should take it easy.

115
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,399
It’s too dangerous.

116
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,080
Colonel Krailert isn’t someone you can mess with.

117
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,639
Thank you, Dao.

118
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,200
Let's dig in.

119
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:05,639
Wanna try this?

120
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:09,759
Just eat it!

121
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,360
Why?

122
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,159
Let’s cool off with some icy treats, shall we?

123
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,519
This reminds me of when you were in boarding school.

124
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:45,879
You came to pick me up in your cadet uniform.

125
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,600
You looked so cool.

126
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,960
I was broke back then.

127
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,559
I could only afford to treat you

128
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,039
a scoop of ice cream—like this.

129
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,200
But it helped with the homesickness.

130
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,639
I really miss my farm house.

131
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,519
So?

132
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:09,399
What’s got you this stressed?

133
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,960
Having trouble adjusting again—

134
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,120
like when you were a kid?

135
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,440
Something like that.

136
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,200
If I were there, I’d be sent to see a psychiatrist.

137
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,919
Is it that serious?

138
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,320
Maybe it’s depression. That’s what I think.

139
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,519
You should see a doctor if you're sick.

140
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,080
But if it’s sadness,

141
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,600
time will heal everything.

142
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,120
That’s the same line you always use when consoling me.

143
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,759
Thank you.

144
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:23,000
Uncle,

145
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,759
you really were worried, weren’t you?

146
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:36,600
Is it the news that’s stressing you out?

147
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,000
Oh.

148
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:41,720
That.

149
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,240
The bid rigging.

150
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,720
Is there some truth to it?

151
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,639
How much truth do you need before it’s called bid rigging?

152
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,200
In any concession,

153
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,879
we have to choose the most capable company—

154
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,880
not just one that’s cheap but low in quality.

155
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,039
The country's benefit must come first.

156
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,119
If the army truly puts the country’s benefit first,

157
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,279
why not be clear and communicate that directly?

158
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,319
That could stop the conflict.

159
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,119
The army's job is to maintain peace and order.

160
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:36,279
We only need to share what's necessary.

161
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,599
For the rest, society needs to trust us.

162
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,200
Just like when you do your job,

163
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,799
giving your best to draft the policies.

164
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,160
Colonel, sir. Can we have an interview?

165
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,519
Sir, please answer the questions.

166
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:49,519
Go ahead.

167
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:50,839
Will the army proceed with

168
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,079
the Huay Kam Saeng power plant project?

169
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:55,960
And how do you plan to deal with the protesters?

170
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,920
"The army respects the people’s right to freedom—

171
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,599
as long as the law and national security are not breached."

172
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,480
Our job is to maintain peace and order.

173
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,519
I’d like to reiterate that

174
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:09,240
all freedoms  must operate within the boundaries of the law.

175
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,160
That's it for today.

176
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,400
Colonel, one more question.

177
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:20,079
Colonel. Sir.

178
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,599
Hey.

179
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,920
Why were you so silent?

180
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:32,519
Where's your fearless self today?

181
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,480
Did Krailert do something to you?

182
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:40,440
What? What could he have done to me?

183
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,440
Let me know which record you'd like.

184
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,759
I can give you my recommendation.

185
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:08,680
Thank you.

186
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,039
Director,

187
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:33,319
with news spreading like this,

188
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,519
wouldn't it cause even a greater conflict

189
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:38,119
between the government and the people?

190
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,279
Shouldn't the PR department do more

191
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:42,039
to help calm the situation?

192
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,240
Umm.

193
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,920
Why don't you ask your uncle?

194
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,160
It's the army's business—

195
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,240
not for my PR department to step in

196
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:06,759
and correct every single piece of news, bro.

197
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,440
Do you want me to hold a press conference

198
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,559
on their behalf?

199
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:11,880
It's not our business to begin with.

200
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,720
For people with bias,

201
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,759
no matter how solid the information you feed them,

202
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,599
they’ll just keep protesting.

203
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:24,359
But they are protesting because they don't understand.

204
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,400
What if we make them see what we see?

205
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:31,400
You're so damn idealistic.

206
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,720
You’ll understand what I mean

207
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,720
when you face the real thing, bro.

208
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,519
Yeah.

209
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,880
- Cheers. / - Cheers.

210
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,240
Drink up. Don't be so serious.

211
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,400
- I'm leaving. / - Alright.

212
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,599
Good luck, sir.

213
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,440
Look at the rain.

214
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,240
Let's go.

215
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:18,680
Hey.

216
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,359
This is Chopin's Nocturnes!

217
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:29,319
Good stuff, huh?

218
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,319
Why so serious?

219
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,240
Life’s short—let’s make the most of it.

220
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,279
I think I’ve made the most of mine.

221
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:04,960
Come on. Let's play in the garden.

222
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,559
No. It's raining.

223
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:11,160
We'll just get wet, not die.

224
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,400
Come quickly!

225
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,279
Because it’s great—

226
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:49,759
people have been listening to it for generations.

227
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,279
That's why it's called classical music.

228
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,880
So you like it 'cause you like it,

229
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,160
or because others like it?

230
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:03,960
Like is like.

231
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:07,960
And what about you?

232
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,960
A hippie like you,

233
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,680
must be digging psychedelic rock.

234
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,759
I like all kinds of music.

235
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:20,279
If we limit ourselves to one category,

236
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,640
how would we know

237
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:25,119
what we might have missed?

238
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,839
- I'm leaving. / - Stay a bit longer.

239
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,200
You're happy now, right?

240
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:46,039
Who told you I'm happy?

241
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:50,440
Since you sat down next to me,

242
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,440
there hasn’t been a single moment

243
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,240
your brows were furrowed.

244
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:59,200
Are you happy?

245
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,480
Yes.

246
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,279
Then stay.

247
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:16,240
If we stay like this forever,

248
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,119
That's too long.

249
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:37,200
moment after moment...

250
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,559
after a moment...

251
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:45,079
It becomes eternity.

252
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,559
moment after moment...

253
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:03,440
after a moment...

254
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,559
Dear readers,

255
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:20,799
The one who truly doesn't know what love

256
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,960
is should be Sarasawadee—

257
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,359
not me.

258
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:27,279
My self-imposed exile from music

259
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,279
hasn’t helped me understand the song any better.

260
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:31,799
If you dare as much as you claim,

261
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,920
then be brave enough to keep listening

262
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,039
to the same old song with me,

263
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,759
until we both agree on its meaning.

264
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,880
How did you get here?

265
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,119
Sir,

266
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:45,680
let me handle him.

267
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:47,880
That's alright. You can leave.

268
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,759
NW

269
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,440
Bh5A

270
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,039
2506

271
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,039
P. 194

272
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,640
Student,

273
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,160
Thanks for letting me gather data from you.

274
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,279
Why didn't you gather my heart, prof.

275
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,039
Well...

276
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,680
Student,

277
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,359
Prof,

278
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,160
don’t you think you’re being too loud?

279
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:37,400
Student,

280
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:40,359
Student,

281
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,759
if the power plants could make my dorm room cooler,

282
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:47,200
I’d have no objections.

283
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,039
You can interview me, prof.

284
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,759
Oh, auntie Noi!

285
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,880
How are you? I miss you, you know?

286
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,839
I miss you too, Tanwa.

287
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,839
Hi guys!

288
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:09,680
That's our super senior. Tanwa!

289
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,640
Watch where you’re going—don’t fall for me.

290
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:15,200
Good morning, senior Tanwa.

291
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,680
Don’t greet me with your palms like that—

292
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,559
you’re already a prof!

293
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,039
Oops, my bad. I forgot.

294
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:21,039
You're still a student?

295
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,359
Hello, Tanwa!

296
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,359
First I majored in history,

297
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:26,519
now I’ve switched to philosophy.

298
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:29,559
- Tanwa, how it's going? / - Hello guys!

299
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:30,559
Have you eaten?

300
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,680
- Of course! / - yes!

301
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,319
It must have been ten years.

302
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:35,920
Haven't you heard?

303
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,359
Learning is for life. This is

304
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,400
the life I've chosen.

305
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:44,720
How can you call this a choice?

306
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,480
Not choosing is also a choice.

307
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,000
Trin, do you think it's wrong...

308
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,359
Let's say

309
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,039
a super senior student and an invited lecturer could...

310
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,119
You're a student.

311
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:13,160
Know your place.

312
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,000
Ran!

313
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:40,519
- Hello! / - Hi guys.

314
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,720
How y'all

315
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,880
Come here.

316
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,839
Yo girls, where you go'in? How ‘bout lunch with me?

317
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,000
- That's her boyfriend! / - Really?

318
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,720
Yes!

319
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,039
Guys!

320
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,920
This is Ran.

321
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,839
He’s a classmate of our seniors.

322
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:00,920
- Hello / - Hello

323
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,279
He works at Siam Daily Mail.

324
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,240
He wants to interview us about Huay Kam Saeng.

325
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,039
Are you the one who wrote about Padoem’s

326
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,599
possible bid rigging through Krailert?

327
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:11,680
Right?

328
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,680
Yes, that's me, bro.

329
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,920
Wow!

330
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,839
You’re so damn cool!

331
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,960
Full respect, bro!

332
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,559
Oh, Ran—

333
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,759
Just now I saw Padoem's son and Krailert's nephew.

334
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:25,839
going somewhere together.

335
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:28,400
They looked close. I bet those two families

336
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,039
must have something going on with the bid rigging.

337
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,720
I thought so too.

338
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,119
We gonna join the seniors rallying the mob?

339
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,079
I have a shift at the hotel.

340
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,480
Just take a leave.

341
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,240
It won't hurt.

342
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,720
That's okay. Let him be.

343
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,480
Let's eat. Victor, are you free today?

344
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,759
We can have a meeting as well.

345
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
I'm free.

346
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:52,440
Where shall we go then?

347
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,119
Boom! Since you're free,

348
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:57,039
we're going to eat at Victor's! Sweet!

349
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,839
Auntie Num's food is to die for.

350
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,440
Simply irresistable.

351
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,160
Ran,

352
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,359
Are you joining us? You should try my mom's food.

353
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,119
Yeah. It tastes heavenly.

354
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,280
Sure, bro.

355
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,400
I'll also interview you guys about the power plants.

356

("My Dear Monster" by Bharadorn Sakda)

358
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,280
Four,

359
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,519
remain in your existence along the path of the world,

360
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,920
where love is nothing but emptiness for you.

361
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,960
Fried duck egg with madan fish sauce. It gotta be mine.

362
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:18,159
Dream on!

363
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:20,679
I’m the guest, you’re the host.

364
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:21,880
It should be mine.

365
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,880
You sure you’re a guest?

366
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:26,599
You eat here barely less than I do.

367
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,719
Look out! What's that?

368
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,199
Hey—what’cha doin’?

369
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,599
Get something else.

370
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:38,960
Do you have to fight like this?

371
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,400
Gosh, stop it already.

372
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,760
What a joke—you eat like cows

373
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,159
and still can’t pay for your own feed!

374
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,039
Hey!

375
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:51,239
Don’t give a damn—just eat.

376
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:57,559
Wait! The fried egg must be shared equally.

377
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,320
Hands off the egg!

378
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:02,679
Tiva, don’t say crap like that in front of others, okay?

379
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:04,239
They'll say you're a fucking commie.

380
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,320
Eat up.

381
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,679
That's at least better than a capitalist dictatorship.

382
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,400
No system is perfect.

383
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,079
Every system has its own flaw.

384
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,440
Uncle, do you want me to bring that to the Reverend?

385
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,480
Thank you, Nuch.

386
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:33,679
Victor, can you bring the funeral speech from my room?

387
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Yes, Pa.

388
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:24,719
Ivan Salenko.

389
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:26,719
Hey, Victor, look at this.

390
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:27,960
What?

391
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,960
Is the author your Pa?

392
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,840

00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:41,719
by Ivan Salenko

395
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,320
No,

396
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:50,719
It can't be published.

397
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,440
Why not?

398
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,599
Because I'm living here illegally.

399
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,199
If the Soviet government finds out,

400
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:00,239
my family will be in trouble.

401
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:03,119
looks like it won't be easy.

402
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:06,639
But the situation has changed.

403
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:09,880
The democratic camp like the US would want it.

404
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:12,800
It should be published for the world to read.

405
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:17,679
This could be the chance

406
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,840
for your voice to be heard again, uncle.

407
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:30,079
Come on, Pa. Things have changed.

408
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:33,119
A country like the USA,

409
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,480
where they have democracy, would want this published.

410
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:39,760
and when it's published,

411
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,159
your voice will be heard all over the world.

412
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,840
You'll get your chance again.

413
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,360
Does my voice even matter

414
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,199
in the world controlled by those in power?

415
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
It has enough value

416
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,119
for them to want to destroy it,

417
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,559
and force you to leave your homeland.

418
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:03,360
That's the reason why

419
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,960
it must be published.

420
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,559
Come on, Pa.

421
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:13,440
Let's do it.

422
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,400
Woohoo! That's it!

423
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:50,800
Yo, Prof!

424
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,480
Your class is over.

425
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,000
What are you doing here?

426
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,760
No answer?

427
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:02,079
That means you can’t let anyone know about it.

428
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:10,519
I'm gathering data from the students for the NESDC

429
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,519
to find solutions for the Huay Kam Saeng power plant project

430
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:16,079
and align with the needs of the people.

431
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,800
You're not the only one

432
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,239
who wants to change this country.

433
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:23,679
I'm doing that right now.

434
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:24,800
Okay.

435
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:28,559
Why don't you ask me?

436
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,400
Aren't I

437
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:32,360
a student?

438
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,159
I need enough samples.

439
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,719
I've got loads of friends in the volunteer club.

440
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,519
But you need to get my permission first.

441
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,159
Stir-fried chicken and ginger on rice.

442
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,639
Don't add too much ginger.

443
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,840
One ginger chicken—no ginger!

444
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,320
One thing,

445
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:26,360
the government is not expelling

446
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,639
people from Huay Kam Saeng.

447
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,840
They want to bring in developers

448
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:32,000
and help improve the community's basic infrastructure.

449
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,840
If we want to build factories,

450
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:36,480
first we need irrigation, electricity, roads.

451
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,079
No doubt you're from a military and capitalist family.

452
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,199
You think just like them.

453
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,079
What if they get money,

454
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:43,920
but have to live with polluted air and water?

455
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,360
How long can they last?

456
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,519
Right, that's why

457
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,760
they need security measures for the community.

458
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,159
And this so-called prosperity,

459
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,159
have the people even asked for it?

460
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,480
Even if they didn't ask for it,

461
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:02,119
does that give you the right to freeze them?

462
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,920
The world has to move forward.

463
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,239
For someone who lives in comfort like you,

464
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:11,719
no doubt you only care about materialistic needs.

465
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:17,840
Mr. Victor,

466
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:22,239
do you think judging people by their economic status—

467
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,360
saying rich people are bad, poor people are good—

468
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,559
is fair to all parties?

469
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,519
I'm on your side.

470
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:33,519
I came from the countryside.

471
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,599
I grew up on the farm.

472
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:43,639
Ginger chicken rice.

473
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:46,079
This is on the house.

474
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:56,800
Didn't you say you want to understand the villagers?

475
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,880
Then you must know how to live and eat like them.

476
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:01,840
This fermented fish chilli paste—

477
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:03,760
can you eat it?

478
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:38,800
"For you alone" by Thatsanarth

Page nineteen

480
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,519
Please tell me, all this time,

481
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,840
what is your feeling for me?

482
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,239
Hatred,

483
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,639
like when I thought of the enemy who annihilated me.

484
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,599
Pretentious,

485
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,840
the look in her eyes

486
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:02,079
betrayed her, revealing the opposite.

487
00:46:11,719 --> 00:46:14,280
Let's say our farewell with this last sentence,

488
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,400
for good.

489
00:46:33,719 --> 00:46:37,320
this life no longer has any meaning,

490
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:49,360
Now that you know the truth,

491
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,480
please go away.

492
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,800
Did he read it?

493
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,800
Why's there no code this time?

494
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:41,920
What are you doing?

495
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,000
Is it right? The thing you're doing?

496
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,840
Why?

497
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:20,519
Is loving someone

498
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:22,840
a crime?

499
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,559
What are you doing?

500
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,119
If you don't want to see me,

501
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,360
why did you keep leaving messages?

502
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,599
Why didn't you run away?

503
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:43,840
It's...

504
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,119
- It's because you never stop, I... / - That's not true.

505
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,719
It's your heart that doesn't want to stop this.

506
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,079
Every book you use is all romance.

507
00:48:56,239 --> 00:48:57,920
The sentences you underlined

508
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,519
were trimmed to sound like rejection—

509
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,440
when in truth, the contexts for those

510
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,679
were love scene, plain and simple.

511
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:10,880
Stop denying it, Naran.

512
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:15,440
Let's listen to our own hearts.

513
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:21,119
That's all your thinking.

514
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,159
I feel nothing for you.

515
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:40,559
What are you looking at?

516
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:45,440
At a stonewaller.

517
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:49,840
Who's the stonewaller?

518
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,360
If you don't have any feelings for me,

519
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,880
just walk away.

520
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:01,639
Why did you kiss me?

521
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,320
Holy shit.

522
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,360
Dear readers,

523
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:37,239
In truth, there are songs we will never fully understand.

524
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:38,960
Yet, sometimes,

525
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,719
we should simply let our emotions flow with the music.

526
00:51:46,599 --> 00:51:51,280
(Forbidden Love)

527
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:00,239
Ma'am,

528
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:03,400
the guayacan tree you ordered is here?

529
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,679
Should I plant it now?

530
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:07,880
How wonderful! Thank you, Veera.

531
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:10,559
Don't you have to accompany the colonel today?

532
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,039
He drove himself today,

533
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:14,599
so I have time to take care of the house.

534
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,679
I see. Then plant it, Veera.

535
00:52:18,039 --> 00:52:19,280
Oh, Veera—

536
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,920
Let me know how much you've spent on the plant.

537
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:24,000
I won't allow you to pay this time.

538
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:26,519
Yes, ma'am.

539
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,840
Hey, Wut.

540
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,880
Say which faculty we're in again?

541
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,480
Political science, dude.

542
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,039
Why are you asking?

543
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:21,079
Why does Victor

544
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:24,000
look so interested in that invited Economic lecturer?

545
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:31,760
True. They used to fight like cats and dogs, but now they seem to get along so well.

546
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,440
Excuse me,

547
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,880
but your opinion is truly naive.

548
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,599
Fixing problems at the structure?

549
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:39,400
Waiting for the next election?

550
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:43,480
That's how democracy works.

551
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:46,079
You can't take to the streets every time there's a problem.

552
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,400
Do we have democracy now?

553
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:50,800
That's why we're protesting.

554
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:56,079
But taking to the streets won’t fix anything—

555
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,880
except for chaos.

556
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,880
I've seen it with my own eyes.

557
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:05,760
People actually died.

558
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,920
They could be someone’s children,

559
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,280
parents,

560
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,880
friends,

561
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,599
or people they love deeply.

562
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,079
Who is to be blamed then? Protesters?

563
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,719
Those giving the orders are sure to be blamed.

564
00:54:28,199 --> 00:54:29,800
It's not as important who's right and who's wrong

565
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,800
as losing someone dear to you.

566
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:33,840
Then what should we do? Pretend to be ignorant

567
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,119
and let them do whatever they want?

568
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:36,840
Not make our demands heard?

569
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:40,239
I’m doing my best for the country right now—

570
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,119
through the economic development plan I'm drafting.

571
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:48,400
That would only benefit the rich and the dictators, like before.

572
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:57,440
Wait and see.

573
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,920
Thank you for debating with me.

574
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:13,000
Trin.

575
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:17,280
They're about to start.

576
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:19,159
But we're still discussing.

577
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:24,880
Trin's here for my gig.

578
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,639
The loudspeakers are loud enough.

579
00:55:27,639 --> 00:55:29,400
I'm sure we can hear it from here.

580
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:39,159
Whoa—

581
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,599
chill out, bro!

582
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:43,679
You know?

583
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,679
That jerk...
