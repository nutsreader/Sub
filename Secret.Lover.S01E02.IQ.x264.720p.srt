00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,170
I know.

174
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,540
But wait,

175
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,490
how are we supposed to perform now?

176
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,200
You two have been helping

177
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,640
Romeo and Juliet
rehearse their lines, right?

178
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,040
You should know all the lines
by now, right?

179
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,370
I...

180
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:36,970
Okay. All right.

181
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,080
Come on, makeup and costume team,
over here.

182
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,470
Take these two to get changed now.

183
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,040
Get in position in 10 minutes,
alright?

184
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,910
I want to see you both ready
in 10 minutes.

185
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,310
Hurry up. Chop chop.

186
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,070
Let's go!

187
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,580
Come on!

188
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,010
Junxi!

189
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,970
Tuo!

190
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,850
Let's go.

191
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,620
Come on.

192
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,210
Tuo!

193
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,830
Let's go.

194
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,890
Junxi!

195
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,670
Why do you have to be Romeo?

196
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,990
What's so important about a surname?

197
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,430
It's neither a part of your body,

198
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,930
nor does it have anything
to do with your soul.

199
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:06,930
Alright.

200
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,790
As long as you say you love me,

201
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,340
I can give up my name.

202
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,330
Tuo.

203
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,230
Why are you so good?

204
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,400
Tuo is such an amazing actor.

205
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,290
No matter what your name is,

206
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,920
you're perfect all the same.

207
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,270
Romeo.

208
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,540
Change your name,

209
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,440
and you'll have me entirely.

210
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,420
Alright,

211
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,540
as you wish.

212
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,500
My love.

213
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,650
Death has taken your breath,

214
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,880
but not your beauty.

215
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,480
You are not conquered.

216
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,180
Your lips

217
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,750
and your cheeks

218
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,510
are still just as rosy.

219
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,530
The ghastly pale of death

220
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,880
has yet to touch you.

221
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,220
Don't be nervous.

222
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,210
It's just a fake kiss through
stage positioning.

223
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,340
I was right to choose these two.

224
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,180
You guys!

225
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,060
You two were absolutely amazing!

226
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,550
You two

227
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,180
were incredible!

228
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,490
Did you see the audience's reaction?

229
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,800
They loved you!

230
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:26,630
That kiss you did

231
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,170
was a stroke of genius!

232
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:27,580
Tuo!

233
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,680
Great!

234
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,840
Let me tell you,

235
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,340
there's no need to worry about...

236
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:30,780
Tuo!

237
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,040
The recruitment of our juniors anymore!

238
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,080
Hey, love you guys!

239
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,660
We agreed on fake kissing.

240
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,260
Why did you actually kiss me?

241
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,780
Don't you want more juniors
to join our drama club?

242
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,450
Of course I do.

243
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,870
Then what's the problem?

244
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,050
Good audience reaction means
more potential members.

245
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,650
Besides, it's not like
we never kissed before.

246
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,370
Even so,

247
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,850
you should have asked me first, okay?

248
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,380
This time it was you who kissed me,

249
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,780
not the other way around.

250
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,910
You pulled me in to kiss you.

251
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,510
I didn't choose to kiss you myself.

252
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,770
Besides, you knew that

253
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,870
I was going to confess my love to Xiaoyang
after the welcome party.

254
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,730
I don't want you to confess to her.

255
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,290
What do you mean?

256
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,810
You don't want me to?

257
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,000
Then why did you agree

258
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,150
to be my dating coach?

259
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,680
I didn't want to coach you either.

260
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,740
I only coached you because
I wanted an excuse to get close to you,

261
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,060
to make you get used to me, accept me,

262
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,320
give up on Xiaoyang, and like me instead.

263
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,730
What are you talking about?

264
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,310
I do like you.

265
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,320
We've always been friends.

266
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,840
We've...

267
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,730
Always been...

268
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,180
I don't want to just be your friend.

269
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,910
I want to be with you,

270
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,860
as your boyfriend.

271
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,710
You're joking, right?

272
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,380
Hurry up. Chop chop.

273
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,120
There's not much time left.

274
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,210
Change your costumes

275
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,530
and pack up the props quickly.

276
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,620
The next club will be here soon.

277
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,350
Hurry up. Chop chop.

278
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,880
You're kidding, right?

279
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,670
Tuo!

280
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,390
The 12 basic principles of animation

281
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,840
are the fundamental techniques
in animation production,

282
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,980
originated from
Disney animators Ollie Johnston

283
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,410
and Frank Thomas's

284
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,930
1981 book,

285
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,790
"The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation."

286
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,110
These principles are widely used
in animation production,

287
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,710
and have influenced the production of
various types of animation.

288
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,360
I didn't want to coach you either.

289
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,130
I only coached you because
I wanted an excuse to get close to you,

290
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,530
to make you get used to me, accept me,

291
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,790
give up on Xiaoyang, and like me instead.

292
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,550
Tuo.

293
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,490
I'm so hungry.

294
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,650
So, so hungry.

295
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,190
Let's eat.

296
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,860
Tuo.

297
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,640
What's going on with you lately?

298
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,230
You've been down since the welcome party.

299
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,090
Got dumped?

300
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,750
Who got dumped?

301
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,390
Me?

302
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,460
Of course not.

303
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,910
I haven't even confessed yet.

304
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,010
How could I be dumped?

305
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,630
Tuo's been acting strange too.

306
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,720
He hasn't been walking to school with us
since the welcome party.

307
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,020
Could it be

308
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,790
he's found someone new
and forgotten the old?

309
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,060
Tuo has a new crush?

310
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,210
Since when?

311
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,080
Who is it?

312
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,910
From which department? Which class?

313
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,060
You're crazy.

314
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,310
I was just kidding.
Why are you so nervous?

315
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,540
Kidding?

316
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,510
Don't joke about that, okay?

317
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,770
He's already popular enough with girls.

318
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,280
Do you mind?

319
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,390
I...

320
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,530
I...

321
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,180
I don't have class this afternoon.

322
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,380
I'll head home first.

323
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:17,109
[You haven't been to school for days.]

324
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:21,270
[Reply when you see this message.]

325
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,250
[It's rude to read and not reply.]

326
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:28,000
[Tuo, I even went to your place
but couldn't find you. Where are you?]

327
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,600
[If you don't reply soon,
I'll tell my mom.]

328
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:50,290
[Are you still mad?]

329
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,570
Tuo.

330
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,550
Where have you been lately?

331
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,510
I couldn't find you at your place,

332
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,400
and you haven't replied

333
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,600
to any of my messages.

334
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,950
Junxi!

335
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,400
Great, you have an umbrella.

336
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,730
Let's go home together.

337
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,450
Take the umbrella.
I have to go catch up with Tuo.

338
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,630
What the hell?

339
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,690
Wait for me!

340
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,030
Han Tuo!

341
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,800
If you keep running,

342
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,460
I'll never speak to you again!

343
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,250
You jerk.

344
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,680
Think you're so great
with those long legs?

345
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,560
You're burning up.

346
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,770
Are you having a fever?

347
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,090
If it's just out of pity,

348
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,880
I don't need it.

349
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,350
Tuo!

350
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,840
If you keep walking,
our friendship is over!

351
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,150
Tuo!

352
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,010
I really won't talk to you anymore.

353
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,760
I'm done with you.

354
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,750
Yet here I am anyway.

355
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,370
I must be an idiot.

356
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,880
Tuo.

357
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,130
Let me in.

358
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,160
Go away.

359
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,140
You're sick. Stop acting tough.

360
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,050
Let go.

361
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,690
It's none of your business
even if I die from this illness.

362
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,230
Go away.

363
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,500
You've got me all confused,

364
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,830
and now you're ignoring me?

365
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,350
Open the door.

366
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,910
Weren't you going to confess
to Lin Xiaoyang?

367
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:46,640
Go ahead.

368
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,060
I won't stop you anymore.

369
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,020
Right!

370
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,670
I was going to confess to Xiaoyang

371
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,110
and be with her,

372
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:53,720
but because of you,

373
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,910
everything has become a mess.

374
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,950
All I could think about is you,

375
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,070
so I forgot to confess to Xiaoyang

376
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,600
and forgot to log in the game
for team battles.

377
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,000
Are you saying

378
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,720
you've been thinking about me
all the time?

379
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,810
You've been thinking about me,

380
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,290
and only me?

381
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,670
Who would think about you?

382
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,320
Always causing trouble
and making me worry.

383
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,520
You might as well die from your illness!

384
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,580
You like me.

385
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,100
You like me.

386
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,340
You like me the same way I like you.

387
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,450
[In the Next Episode]

388
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,370
So you two have made up...

389
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,000
No, you two are even closer now, right?

390
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,090
Lu Junxi!

391
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,640
I'm coming!

392
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,030
Here's my application form.

393
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,960
I'm not a junior. Can I still apply?

394
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:46,230
Go ahead and
keep taking care of your juniors.

395
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,690
They're always chatting around you anyway.

396
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,560
Why is it that

397
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,630
I suddenly feel suffocated?
