Hello,

00:35.780 --> 00:36.760
Master...

00:39.040 --> 00:41.040
I told you to stay out of it.

00:41.240 --> 00:43.040
Khem's a good guy.

00:43.240 --> 00:44.840
You'd better go keep him safe.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.800
The night's far from over.

00:49.360 --> 00:50.640
They're here.

(Incanting)

03:52.880 --> 03:53.760
Grand Master,

03:55.040 --> 03:56.360
is he gonna die?

03:59.640 --> 04:01.120
Everyone dies eventually.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.320
It's all part of karma.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.120
But...

04:06.520 --> 04:08.480
that boy's karmic enemy...

04:09.680 --> 04:11.440
Not even I can stop it.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.920
Even you can't do anything.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.480
But you don't need to worry.

04:18.640 --> 04:19.839
That boy's got...

04:20.600 --> 04:23.880
at least ten more years.

04:24.200 --> 04:25.400
I have less than that.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.200
By the time his day comes,

04:28.880 --> 04:30.680
I'll already be gone.

04:33.880 --> 04:34.960
When the time comes,

04:35.600 --> 04:36.840
I'll be the one to help him.

04:44.600 --> 04:45.960
I've warned you many times.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.880
You are meant to stick with white magic,

04:49.920 --> 04:52.200
and your duty is to protect our village.

04:56.159 --> 04:57.680
My power is black magic,

04:59.400 --> 05:00.920
and I meddled with things
I shouldn't have.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.720
That's what took your mom's life.

05:09.600 --> 05:10.920
Promise me

05:11.560 --> 05:15.560
you'll never interfere
with someone else's karma,

- Yes.
- We are.

05:50.050 --> 05:50.460

(Incanting)

09:17.800 --> 09:19.400
Are you looking for me?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.320
Give me the boy,

09:24.640 --> 09:26.680
and I shall spare the rest of you.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.400
What has he done to you?

09:28.960 --> 09:30.440
Can't you just let him go?

09:31.720 --> 09:33.880
It's not your place to know.

09:33.920 --> 09:37.900
If you hold on to hatred
and keep causing harm,

09:37.940 --> 09:39.140
no good shall come of it...

09:39.180 --> 09:40.200
Shut your mouth.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.280
Whatever I choose to do

09:44.320 --> 09:46.520
is no concern of yours.

09:47.560 --> 09:50.040
You'll either give him to me

09:50.800 --> 09:53.000
or foolishly try to stand in my way.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.400
Your grandfather failed to stop me.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.400
But you, so naive and powerless...

10:04.040 --> 10:06.440
Do not presume to defy me.

10:08.920 --> 10:10.820
Come what may,

10:10.860 --> 10:13.880
I shall never let him go.

10:15.360 --> 10:16.760
I'll make him suffer

10:16.800 --> 10:19.440
for as long as I want.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.560
His fate is not yours to alter.

- Yes, Master.

When I was a kid,

19:48.640 --> 19:50.040
I came here.

I'm sure I did.

for keeping me safe until now.

some tough times, too, right?

23:16.560 --> 23:18.640
- Yeah.
- I still have so much left to paint.

- I've been working on it since morning.
- Jet...

- You're just too fast.
- You woke up late, didn't you?

23:26.400 --> 23:29.000
You're just too fast, Khem.

23:29.560 --> 23:30.760
Show me yours.

23:31.000 --> 23:31.880
Look.

23:32.880 --> 23:35.760
Isn't the color of the lotus
kinda weird?

23:35.800 --> 23:36.800
What do you think?

23:37.080 --> 23:38.280
Well...

23:40.240 --> 23:41.360
I think it looks great,

23:41.400 --> 23:44.400
but maybe it could use
a bit more blending here.

23:47.800 --> 23:48.800
Whoa.

23:49.640 --> 23:52.000
You did this in just half a day?

23:52.400 --> 23:53.720
It looks awesome.

23:54.640 --> 23:57.080
I kinda pushed myself to finish it.

23:57.320 --> 23:58.520
Whoa.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.840
So this is the hand
of a legendary artist.

24:01.560 --> 24:02.560
So soft!

24:02.840 --> 24:03.920
You're overdoing it, Prae.

24:03.960 --> 24:04.840
Stop it.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.000
You didn't need to hold his hand.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.360
- Okay.
- It's okay.

24:09.400 --> 24:10.240
Here,

24:10.840 --> 24:12.760
look at Praemai's artwork.

24:13.040 --> 24:14.160
It's really pretty.

24:14.400 --> 24:17.400
The color balance is on point,

24:17.440 --> 24:19.640
and so are the details on the clothes.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.400
That was such an in-depth comment.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.920
Should I be expecting
a grade, Professor?

24:26.320 --> 24:28.280
What about eighth grade?

24:28.320 --> 24:30.320
Aren't we talking about an A, B, or C?

24:32.280 --> 24:33.840
Oh, Charn! You're here.

24:33.880 --> 24:34.680
Come here.

24:35.880 --> 24:37.080
Have you seen Khem's painting?

24:37.520 --> 24:38.240
Right there.

24:38.880 --> 24:39.840
It's amazing.

24:47.200 --> 24:48.800
The detail in it is impressive,

24:49.680 --> 24:50.960
especially in the woman.

24:51.560 --> 24:53.120
She looks really kind.

24:56.280 --> 24:59.280
I used my mom's photo as a reference.

25:00.880 --> 25:02.080
If she sees this,

25:02.120 --> 25:03.570
she'll be really proud.

25:12.800 --> 25:13.800
You're...

25:15.120 --> 25:16.560
no longer with your mom, right?

25:17.560 --> 25:18.640
Please forgive me for being rude.

25:19.760 --> 25:20.840
I'm sorry for your loss.

25:21.360 --> 25:22.720
Charn, look up!

25:22.920 --> 25:24.720
You're overdoing it, too.

25:25.160 --> 25:26.440
Forgive us, Khem.

25:26.800 --> 25:28.280
This camp is full of weirdos.

25:28.640 --> 25:29.640
It's okay.

25:30.200 --> 25:31.520
Actually,

25:32.200 --> 25:33.560
it's been a long time since she passed.

25:43.720 --> 25:45.200
Nice to meet you, Khem.

25:46.840 --> 25:47.960
Whoa...

25:48.000 --> 25:50.320
Why so formal?

25:52.000 --> 25:52.920
Well,

25:54.480 --> 25:55.480
nice to meet you, too!

26:01.520 --> 26:03.720
Prae, are you done?

26:06.200 --> 26:07.200
Wow.

26:07.920 --> 26:09.280
This looks gorgeous, babe.

26:10.440 --> 26:12.200
I didn't do this alone.

26:12.240 --> 26:15.640
This is all from the hands
of a legend, Khemjira.

26:16.360 --> 26:17.600
Khemjira?

26:18.320 --> 26:19.120
Right!

26:19.360 --> 26:20.400
That's him,

26:20.440 --> 26:22.440
the guy with a girl's name.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.320
- I see.
- Yeah.

26:24.480 --> 26:26.280
Honestly, I'd totally believe
he's a tomboy.

26:26.320 --> 26:27.960
- He's gorgeous.
- You're right, dude.

26:28.680 --> 26:29.680
In this day and age,

26:30.480 --> 26:31.680
isn't it inappropriate

26:32.160 --> 26:33.760
to judge people by how they look

26:34.160 --> 26:35.480
and joke about their gender identity?

26:37.680 --> 26:38.740
Why so serious, dude?

26:39.800 --> 26:41.920
We just meant to say he's cute.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.400
Just take it as a compliment, man.

26:45.880 --> 26:47.080
Let us know if you need anything.

26:48.920 --> 26:50.560
Hey, what are you doing?

26:51.760 --> 26:53.320
Get your hands off Khem now.

26:53.360 --> 26:54.320
Stay right there.

26:54.360 --> 26:55.800
I'll take care of every one of you.

26:58.480 --> 26:59.480
What the fuck?

27:00.000 --> 27:01.680
Is Khem a monk or something?

27:01.720 --> 27:03.240
Why can't we touch him?

27:04.680 --> 27:05.600
Well...

27:05.640 --> 27:08.640
If you're done with your work,

27:08.800 --> 27:10.360
how about giving them a hand?

27:10.400 --> 27:11.680
They want you there.

27:12.320 --> 27:13.200
Come on.

27:13.360 --> 27:14.320
Just go.

27:14.360 --> 27:15.560
Now, alright?

27:15.800 --> 27:17.480
- What the hell?
- Go!

27:17.520 --> 27:18.320
Let's go.

27:25.140 --> 27:26.340
Did they hurt you?

27:29.000 --> 27:30.560
Jeez, acting like total thugs...

27:30.600 --> 27:31.680
They're just a bunch of jerks.

27:33.320 --> 27:35.320
Look who's talking.

27:40.040 --> 27:41.760
They were just being friendly.

27:42.440 --> 27:44.040
New friends are fine, right?

27:47.760 --> 27:48.760
Who's this guy?

27:49.140 --> 27:50.060
A new friend, too?

27:53.960 --> 27:55.080
I'm right here.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.480
Why don't you just ask me?

28:01.840 --> 28:02.840
Actually,

28:03.520 --> 28:04.680
when you want to get to know someone,

28:05.120 --> 28:06.320
shouldn't you introduce yourself first?

28:06.360 --> 28:08.080
What? You're getting on my nerves.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.800
- Hey...
- Who said I wanna know you?

28:15.360 --> 28:16.440
Come on.

28:17.080 --> 28:18.280
What's wrong with you guys?

28:21.720 --> 28:23.920
This is Charn,

28:24.600 --> 28:25.720
also a junior.

28:26.420 --> 28:27.620
He's a psychology student.

28:28.480 --> 28:30.680
This is Jet,

28:31.160 --> 28:32.240
my best friend.

28:36.880 --> 28:40.100
Since we're all here together,

28:42.960 --> 28:44.960
it wouldn't hurt to be friends,

28:47.680 --> 28:48.560
right?

29:11.280 --> 29:13.000
It's indeed full of weirdos.

29:19.040 --> 29:20.720
- Here we go.
- Alright.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.770
- Sod Chaeng!
- Sod Chaeng!

29:29.360 --> 29:32.240
Coconut rum,
Ubon Ratchathani's local gem!

29:32.280 --> 29:34.680
You can't get it in Bangkok, you know!

29:34.960 --> 29:36.200
Exactly, Worn.

29:36.560 --> 29:37.560
Smells so nice.

29:37.600 --> 29:38.800
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

29:38.960 --> 29:42.080
It's not often I get to drink
with the young ones.

29:42.440 --> 29:43.440
I'm enjoying this.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.680
- Yeah.
- Right.

29:45.720 --> 29:47.360
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

29:47.600 --> 29:48.600
Some snacks.

29:49.440 --> 29:51.080
- Here.
- Thanks.

29:51.720 --> 29:52.520
Rae!

29:53.160 --> 29:54.040
- Yes?
- Rae!

29:54.080 --> 29:55.720
- Yes?
- Bring us more snacks.

29:55.760 --> 29:56.680
- Okay.
- These are almost gone.

29:56.720 --> 29:57.680
Here you go.

29:59.320 --> 30:01.110
This is also a local gem.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.110
- Wow.
- My wife made it.

30:06.120 --> 30:09.400
We're probably gonna drink
this Sod Chaeng till dawn.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.960
Rae, you can head to bed first.
We don't mind.

30:12.000 --> 30:12.880
Come on,

30:13.520 --> 30:14.840
she always stays up late.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.120
Let her be here

30:16.520 --> 30:17.920
in case we want something.

30:22.040 --> 30:23.680
Yeah, I usually stay up late.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.120
If you need anything, just tell me.

30:26.160 --> 30:27.240
I'll get it for you.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.160
But...

30:30.440 --> 30:32.040
don't drink too much, okay?

30:32.080 --> 30:34.480
I heard you have
an early start tomorrow, right?

30:45.880 --> 30:47.080
Hey, Worn,

30:47.640 --> 30:48.720
cheers.

30:50.120 --> 30:51.920
- Oh, cheers!
- Come on.

30:52.520 --> 30:55.120
- Sod Chaeng!
- Sod Chaeng!

31:24.580 --> 31:25.100
Guys.

31:27.000 --> 31:27.800
Hey.

31:28.840 --> 31:30.640
Why don't you go upstairs?

31:35.480 --> 31:36.440
Argh!

31:38.360 --> 31:39.360
Please stop.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.720
What the hell do you do for me each day?

32:04.400 --> 32:06.880
I'm working hard to make money for you,

32:07.200 --> 32:09.080
and you have the nerve
to boss me around?

32:12.760 --> 32:14.040
That's not what I did.

32:14.080 --> 32:15.040
I was just telling you

32:15.080 --> 32:17.100
- 'cause you might have to work early.
- Shut your mouth.

32:17.140 --> 32:19.080
- Should I just kill you now?
- Argh!

32:19.310 --> 32:20.160
Worn...

32:20.200 --> 32:21.800
- Should I?
- Please...

32:48.080 --> 32:49.280
Kill? Seriously?

32:49.320 --> 32:50.480
You sure it wasn't a dream?

32:50.840 --> 32:52.080
A dream, my ass.

32:52.120 --> 32:54.040
He was totally losing it,
like he was possessed.

32:54.920 --> 32:56.640
He kept beating his wife badly.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.240
Beating his wife?

32:58.360 --> 32:59.560
Which Worn are you talking about?

33:01.560 --> 33:03.760
The one who brought us the tools?

33:05.960 --> 33:07.240
No way. It's not him.

33:07.280 --> 33:08.680
He's a good guy.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.310
He's also nice, actually.

33:10.350 --> 33:11.280
Yeah.

33:11.320 --> 33:13.640
He was breaking up a dogfight
at the temple the other day,

33:13.840 --> 33:15.040
and he wouldn't even dare to hit them.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.480
He was completely normal
to his wife this morning.

33:17.520 --> 33:18.920
You're making things up, bro.

33:20.040 --> 33:20.880
Right.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.560
No one believes me at all.

33:23.440 --> 33:25.440
Who would actually fight
in front of their guests?

33:34.040 --> 33:36.600
If you're sure about it,
you should tell the locals here.

33:37.560 --> 33:38.960
You're staying at their place.

33:39.520 --> 33:41.040
If something goes wrong,
you'll be in trouble.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.280
And domestic violence...

33:44.040 --> 33:45.400
isn't something to be ignored.

33:45.800 --> 33:46.680
Exactly.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.400
And it's none of your business.

33:48.440 --> 33:49.920
- Hey!
- Hey!

33:49.960 --> 33:50.760
Stop it!

33:51.960 --> 33:52.960
Stay here.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
Sit down.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.040
Eat your food.

33:59.160 --> 34:00.360
Just eat it.

34:01.280 --> 34:02.240
Sorry.

34:04.760 --> 34:05.760
What were you tryna do?

34:07.340 --> 34:08.760
Why would you get involved?

34:09.250 --> 34:11.840
Don't forget the reason you're here.

34:12.540 --> 34:13.679
I know,

34:15.260 --> 34:17.400
but I don't know what to do.

34:19.460 --> 34:21.600
I haven't even had a chance
to talk to Master yet.

34:23.760 --> 34:24.600
Come on,

34:25.800 --> 34:27.000
nothing about it is hard.

34:48.780 --> 34:49.639
Your food, Master.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.840
Well... Uh...

34:55.560 --> 34:57.560
I just wanted to thank you...

34:57.600 --> 34:59.720
for replacing my necklace cord
the other day.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.600
Please give it a try.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.240
If you don't like it,

35:06.920 --> 35:08.240
I'll adjust the seasoning for you.

35:29.360 --> 35:30.360
How is it, Master?

35:31.160 --> 35:32.440
Fantastic, right?

35:35.560 --> 35:36.640
It's alright.

35:38.560 --> 35:40.840
Don't bother adding more stuff to it.

35:48.960 --> 35:50.560
And if you keep staring at me like that,

35:51.600 --> 35:52.880
I don't think I have any appetite.

35:57.080 --> 35:58.480
Go change your shirt.

36:17.040 --> 36:17.840
Okay.

37:09.680 --> 37:10.680
He ate it all.

37:11.360 --> 37:12.960
Thought he said
it was just alright, huh?

37:17.280 --> 37:18.280
Master!

37:19.560 --> 37:20.760
Leave that to me.

37:21.040 --> 37:22.240
I'll clear the table.

37:23.040 --> 37:23.840
Alright.

37:24.880 --> 37:25.880
Please get it done.

37:29.160 --> 37:30.000
Uh...

37:30.040 --> 37:30.920
Master,

37:32.720 --> 37:35.120
may I have a moment with you?

37:37.720 --> 37:39.520
You have that much free time?

37:40.840 --> 37:42.720
Is there nothing to do at the camp?

37:46.320 --> 37:47.520
I mean...

37:50.080 --> 37:52.560
Since Grand Master Sek saved me before,

37:53.560 --> 37:56.720
he might have left some way
to break my curse.

37:58.080 --> 37:59.080
Do you...

38:00.400 --> 38:01.800
happen to know anything about it?

38:05.920 --> 38:08.120
It was him who warned me

38:09.040 --> 38:11.120
to stay away from people's karma.

38:12.320 --> 38:13.920
I've said enough. Hope you understand.

38:19.920 --> 38:21.120
Please help me.

38:22.280 --> 38:23.120
Please.

38:24.300 --> 38:25.300
I'm begging you.

38:29.320 --> 38:30.320
Don't do this.

38:32.440 --> 38:33.440
I can't help you.

38:39.240 --> 38:42.240
Do you want me to break my promise
to my grandfather for you?

39:04.320 --> 39:06.040
I know it might sound selfish,

39:08.960 --> 39:10.560
but I don't think...

39:11.280 --> 39:14.160
you can stand
seeing people suffer, right?

39:26.680 --> 39:29.880
[Phra Nakhon, 1939]

39:51.640 --> 39:52.840
Mister...

39:53.000 --> 39:53.720
Sir!

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Mister,

39:57.880 --> 39:59.280
I'm up here!

40:05.920 --> 40:08.320
Can you please get me a ladder?

40:08.920 --> 40:09.690
I mean...

40:10.840 --> 40:12.480
I can't get back down.

40:19.920 --> 40:20.920
Uh...

40:31.400 --> 40:33.200
Say thanks to him.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.360
Aw.

40:36.040 --> 40:37.240
You're sleeping, huh?

40:37.840 --> 40:39.040
Is this your cat?

40:39.440 --> 40:40.640
No, it's not.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.260
I don't know where it came from,

40:42.300 --> 40:43.960
but it was stuck up there.

40:53.640 --> 40:55.960
So you went up to help the cat

40:56.280 --> 40:58.280
and ended up stuck there yourself?

41:00.080 --> 41:02.680
The way it cried just broke my heart.

41:03.560 --> 41:06.240
All I thought about was saving it.
I didn't even think about myself.

41:07.760 --> 41:09.440
You also wanted to help me.

41:09.960 --> 41:11.960
You looked totally shocked

41:12.720 --> 41:15.120
when you saw me up there.

41:25.320 --> 41:26.520
Thank you.

41:27.920 --> 41:29.120
You're...

41:30.880 --> 41:31.880
Pawat.

41:32.440 --> 41:33.840
I'm Pawat Wongpradit.

41:34.840 --> 41:37.040
Pawat Wongpradit...

41:38.080 --> 41:39.280
That's a beautiful name.

41:42.040 --> 41:42.830
Oh,

41:43.160 --> 41:45.160
I'm Khem,

41:46.320 --> 41:47.520
Khemmika.

42:12.840 --> 42:15.240
I've fixed all the windows now, Master.

42:16.360 --> 42:17.360
Thanks a lot.

42:18.240 --> 42:19.040
So...

42:20.600 --> 42:21.600
I'll see you later.

42:27.720 --> 42:28.720
Goodbye.

42:45.280 --> 42:47.400
He was totally losing it,
like he was possessed.

42:47.680 --> 42:49.360
He kept beating his wife badly.

42:55.880 --> 42:56.760
Look.

42:56.800 --> 42:57.800
- About what you asked...
- Master...

43:02.800 --> 43:03.800
Is it possible...

43:05.680 --> 43:06.480
that...

43:07.400 --> 43:09.160
Worn might be possessed?

43:18.040 --> 43:19.840
You saw the energy, didn't you?

43:23.880 --> 43:26.200
My guess is he went into the forest
to fetch something

43:26.960 --> 43:28.560
and passed through those spirits.

43:32.000 --> 43:35.280
Living with nature and spirits
is just the way things are here.

43:37.160 --> 43:38.160
It's nothing unusual.

44:20.240 --> 44:22.200
Still got some booze?
I'll have some tonight.

44:22.240 --> 44:23.720
You drank it all, though...

44:35.640 --> 44:36.640
Worn!

44:38.120 --> 44:38.960
Worn.

44:40.840 --> 44:42.080
- Hello.
- Hi.

44:43.520 --> 44:45.280
- You forgot this.
- Oh, thanks.

44:46.320 --> 44:47.520
So many of you came.

44:47.800 --> 44:49.320
Did Te invite you over for drinks?

44:51.640 --> 44:52.640
Oh...

44:53.140 --> 44:54.440
We don't drink.

44:54.680 --> 44:58.600
But Te and the others
always talk about Rae's fermented pork.

44:59.480 --> 45:02.480
We were wondering
if we could try a little.

45:03.160 --> 45:03.880
Right?

45:05.800 --> 45:07.000
- That's right.
- Yes.

45:07.040 --> 45:08.320
- Yeah.
- Right.

45:08.360 --> 45:09.880
Rae, still got some fermented pork?

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
Yes.

45:15.160 --> 45:16.640
Come on, join me.

45:16.680 --> 45:17.480
Let's eat.

45:18.040 --> 45:18.840
Okay.

45:22.640 --> 45:23.920
Why would you be here, too?

45:24.960 --> 45:26.280
Khem asked me to come.

45:26.640 --> 45:27.640
You didn't need to know.

45:39.400 --> 45:41.000
This one is ready. It's already sour.

45:41.040 --> 45:42.800
Just put it in the fridge,
and it's good to go.

45:43.320 --> 45:45.920
- Thank you.
- The other two still need time.

45:45.960 --> 45:48.880
Leave them out for now,
and put them in the fridge tomorrow.

45:48.920 --> 45:50.880
Whoa, this is way too much, Rae.

45:50.920 --> 45:52.260
- I feel bad taking so much.
- Don't worry about it.

45:52.300 --> 45:54.200
I always make extra. Worn loves it.

45:55.040 --> 45:56.200
Go ahead and share it with everyone.

46:01.240 --> 46:02.120
Rae,

46:05.760 --> 46:06.960
what happened to you?

46:11.280 --> 46:12.080
Uh...

46:13.760 --> 46:14.760
I fell.

46:15.260 --> 46:17.460
That's all. I'm alright.

46:26.280 --> 46:28.080
Stay out of this, Khem.

46:28.120 --> 46:29.920
Rae might've actually fallen over.

46:30.760 --> 46:32.960
It was so obvious
a toddler could see right through it.

46:34.840 --> 46:35.840
I know!

46:36.240 --> 46:37.520
I'm not that stupid.

46:38.520 --> 46:40.080
Even if Worn actually hurt his wife,

46:40.120 --> 46:41.200
it's none of our business, right?

46:42.480 --> 46:45.200
What if he's actually possessed?

46:48.120 --> 46:49.240
Possessed?

46:49.280 --> 46:50.440
By what?

46:56.160 --> 46:57.160
A party spirit, perhaps?

46:58.960 --> 47:00.200
You, too, Khem.

47:00.520 --> 47:01.680
Don't say such things.

47:04.080 --> 47:05.400
Uh...

47:06.760 --> 47:08.150
We've arrived at the Master's house.

47:08.190 --> 47:10.760
By the way,
why are you following us, Chan?

47:10.800 --> 47:13.000
Aren't you supposed to be
on your way back to Auntie Kaew's?

47:13.120 --> 47:14.820
It's way over there, on the same route.

47:15.360 --> 47:17.640
Both of us have to go now.

47:18.080 --> 47:19.480
See you, okay?

47:20.120 --> 47:21.120
Let's go, Jet.

47:21.520 --> 47:22.800
We need to go now.

47:23.880 --> 47:24.760
Quickly.

47:47.440 --> 47:48.640
Hey, Worn.

47:49.440 --> 47:50.440
Take it easy.

47:50.800 --> 47:52.340
Are you starving or something?

47:52.760 --> 47:53.760
Come on,

47:54.540 --> 47:56.280
it's once in a while, man.

47:57.700 --> 47:58.900
Once in a while?

47:59.400 --> 48:00.800
You literally drink every day.

48:03.600 --> 48:04.280
What is it?

48:06.440 --> 48:07.160
Look,

48:07.920 --> 48:08.920
be honest with me.

48:09.820 --> 48:10.820
You worried about something?

48:15.710 --> 48:16.730
Got some problems?

48:19.240 --> 48:20.720
Someone like me?

48:21.240 --> 48:23.440
There's no way I'd have any problems.

48:45.600 --> 48:46.600
How's it going

48:49.680 --> 48:50.680
with your wife, Rae?

48:52.240 --> 48:53.240
We're fine.

48:54.720 --> 48:55.970
What problems could there be?

48:58.840 --> 49:00.030
No problems at all?

49:00.070 --> 49:00.870
No.

49:07.700 --> 49:08.900
Married couples

49:09.800 --> 49:11.120
do fight, you know.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.480
Kaew and I argue all the time,

49:14.080 --> 49:16.680
but we never get physical.

49:18.640 --> 49:19.480
Hey...

49:21.480 --> 49:22.800
I'm not the kind of guy

49:24.120 --> 49:26.520
who'd lay a hand on Rae.

49:27.240 --> 49:28.040
Jeez.

49:33.080 --> 49:33.960
Who's that?

49:41.360 --> 49:42.160
Hey!

49:43.160 --> 49:44.040
That boy,

49:44.600 --> 49:45.530
come here.

49:56.960 --> 49:57.960
Well... I...

50:00.360 --> 50:01.480
Auntie Kaew asked me to come.

50:04.040 --> 50:07.240
You know, she's Uncle Chai's wife.

50:07.440 --> 50:09.440
She's really kind and...

50:11.040 --> 50:12.040
I get it.

50:12.440 --> 50:13.280
I'll be there.

50:13.640 --> 50:14.560
Thanks a lot.

50:14.980 --> 50:15.580
Okay.

50:17.360 --> 50:18.360
Want some drinks?

50:18.880 --> 50:22.640
Did my wife tell you
to tell Chai about this?

50:29.300 --> 50:30.320
What do you mean?

50:30.360 --> 50:31.200
I don't...

50:31.240 --> 50:32.160
I have no idea.

50:32.640 --> 50:35.400
Did my wife tell you I beat her?

50:38.000 --> 50:39.400
Hey, Worn!

50:39.440 --> 50:40.440
Take it easy.

50:41.160 --> 50:42.480
Why take it out on him?

50:42.520 --> 50:43.520
He has no idea.

50:45.080 --> 50:45.880
Just finish your drink.

50:46.560 --> 50:48.280
You called me here

50:50.240 --> 50:52.840
'cause you chose to take her side?

50:54.360 --> 50:55.360
Hey, wait.

50:55.920 --> 50:56.720
Wait, Worn!

50:56.760 --> 50:58.560
Jeez, you son of a bitch.

51:02.960 --> 51:03.760
What?

51:05.840 --> 51:06.560
Seriously?

51:07.600 --> 51:08.400
So...

51:08.960 --> 51:10.360
how is Worn now?

51:11.800 --> 51:12.800
Okay.

51:13.880 --> 51:15.680
It's damn late. Where are you going?

51:17.680 --> 51:18.680
Charn called.

51:20.800 --> 51:22.520
He told Uncle Chai about Worn,

51:23.120 --> 51:24.760
so Uncle Chai warned him.

51:24.800 --> 51:27.880
And now he's mad,
thinking Rae told Uncle Chai about him.

51:28.160 --> 51:29.160
Right now,

51:29.440 --> 51:31.720
he's heading home, totally drunk.

51:32.880 --> 51:33.880
I'm afraid...

51:35.000 --> 51:36.400
that Rae might get hurt.

51:37.640 --> 51:38.680
Shit!

51:39.360 --> 51:40.320
When did you...

51:40.840 --> 51:42.260
give Charn your number?

51:42.300 --> 51:43.320
Gosh.

51:43.920 --> 51:46.240
That's the only thing you picked up?

51:46.760 --> 51:48.200
It's not the point at all.

51:48.640 --> 51:50.040
Fine, my bad.

51:50.520 --> 51:52.400
I told you
to stay out of their business.

51:57.720 --> 51:58.680
But if you're going,

52:02.320 --> 52:03.280
I'm coming with you.

52:58.480 --> 52:59.480
Rae!

53:00.640 --> 53:02.240
Rae, where are you?

53:02.760 --> 53:03.760
Worn?

53:05.480 --> 53:06.800
You're drinking again?

53:07.760 --> 53:09.240
Leave me alone.

53:09.280 --> 53:10.400
You should stop.

53:10.880 --> 53:11.760
Let go.

53:11.800 --> 53:13.600
- Please, Worn.
- Go away.

53:19.680 --> 53:20.760
Kill them...

53:21.360 --> 53:22.840
Do it.

53:23.160 --> 53:24.040
You bitch.

53:24.440 --> 53:26.440
You talk too much.

53:29.920 --> 53:32.960
I'll make sure you can't tell anyone
a damn thing anymore.

53:33.680 --> 53:35.280
- Worn...
- You bitch.

53:36.040 --> 53:37.680
Please don't do it.

53:37.940 --> 53:38.980
Stop it, Worn.

53:39.120 --> 53:40.000
Let go of me!

53:40.200 --> 53:41.440
- Leave me alone.
- Are you alright, Rae?

53:41.480 --> 53:42.760
- Don't mess with me.
- You're safe now.

53:43.960 --> 53:44.960
Let go of me.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.190
- What are you doing?
- Go away.

53:50.080 --> 53:51.100
Have you gone nuts?

53:51.140 --> 53:52.800
Stay out of our fucking business.

53:55.680 --> 53:57.080
Kill them...

53:57.720 --> 53:59.400
Kill them all.

53:59.840 --> 54:01.640
Kill everyone.

54:01.800 --> 54:03.720
I will kill you all.

54:03.760 --> 54:05.840
Kill them.

54:06.400 --> 54:09.200
Kill them now.

54:10.120 --> 54:11.080
(Incanting)

54:11.120 --> 54:12.120
What are you doing?

54:14.880 --> 54:16.160
Exorcising.

54:16.200 --> 54:17.240
He's freaking possessed.

54:18.200 --> 54:20.180
(Incanting)

54:20.220 --> 54:21.640
Stop it, Chai.

54:21.680 --> 54:22.480
That's enough.

54:23.360 --> 54:24.960
He's not the one possessed.

54:29.680 --> 54:31.410
The one who's really possessed

54:32.120 --> 54:33.600
is this bitch.

54:48.160 --> 54:48.880
You...

54:49.560 --> 54:50.360
Rae!

54:51.640 --> 54:52.360
Come.

55:03.600 --> 55:05.600
I will kill you all.

55:07.400 --> 55:07.990
Rae...

55:08.240 --> 55:08.880
Rae...

55:09.640 --> 55:11.760
- Please.
- Rae's surely tough.

55:12.760 --> 55:14.760
She's endured your shit all this time.

55:19.680 --> 55:21.280
Worn! Rae!

55:21.760 --> 55:23.720
We're back!

55:23.760 --> 55:25.360
Did you make us dinner?

55:25.560 --> 55:26.760
We're so hungry.

55:26.800 --> 55:28.240
Got any leftovers?

55:28.280 --> 55:29.680
Are you home, Worn?

56:17.960 --> 56:18.960
What's wrong, Jet?

56:21.040 --> 56:22.340
Take a look around.

56:30.480 --> 56:31.480
Actually,

56:32.760 --> 56:34.960
we've gone through this bamboo grove
over and over.

56:38.560 --> 56:39.560
We're being messed with.

56:56.400 --> 56:57.200
Khem!

57:05.960 --> 57:06.960
What the fuck is going on?

57:13.840 --> 57:14.640
Khem!

57:27.840 --> 57:28.640
Rae...

57:30.280 --> 57:33.880
Make your choice. Who will you save?

57:36.520 --> 57:37.520
Stop that.

57:37.560 --> 57:38.860
Rae!

57:41.640 --> 57:42.440
Rae...

57:47.920 --> 57:48.760
Rae,

57:48.800 --> 57:49.720
please don't do this.

57:49.760 --> 57:50.760
I'm sorry.

57:53.600 --> 57:54.760
It's too late.

57:55.800 --> 57:57.160
Your Rae

57:57.200 --> 57:58.680
is gone.

58:00.520 --> 58:02.320
Don't do that!

58:04.680 --> 58:05.360
Rae...

58:05.400 --> 58:06.360
Please don't.

58:06.400 --> 58:07.280
Stop.

58:31.960 --> 58:33.760
You chose to come here.

58:33.800 --> 58:37.160
I suppose that means
my lady's gotten hold of that boy.

58:37.440 --> 58:39.440
Get out of this body.

58:39.660 --> 58:40.920
You don't belong here.

58:40.960 --> 58:43.960
She's been dying
to kill that bastard for ages.

58:44.720 --> 58:46.320
I just gave her what she wanted.

58:46.520 --> 58:47.920
It's her choice.

58:48.760 --> 58:49.880
Stay out of this.

58:51.320 --> 58:53.720
Don't involve yourself
in karma that isn't yours to carry.

58:53.760 --> 58:56.640
What about those who wronged my lady?

58:57.560 --> 58:59.960
Have they paid for their sins?

59:05.720 --> 59:08.520
This is what Rae wants.

59:08.920 --> 59:10.440
Even you can't stop it.

59:14.720 --> 59:15.720
Rae!

59:16.680 --> 59:17.960
Rae...

59:22.640 --> 59:25.040
You'd better not
underestimate me and my disciple.

59:28.560 --> 59:29.560
What the fuck is going on?

59:30.460 --> 59:31.360
Khem!

59:37.040 --> 59:37.760
Jet,

59:37.800 --> 59:39.000
can you hear me?

59:39.240 --> 59:40.120
Master!

59:40.720 --> 59:41.840
Please help Khem.

59:43.440 --> 59:44.880
Listen.

59:45.520 --> 59:46.780
You need to help him.

59:46.820 --> 59:47.560
What?

59:48.400 --> 59:49.480
Why's that?

59:49.840 --> 59:51.060
There's no time to explain.

59:51.100 --> 59:53.320
I'm gonna let you see spirits
for a while.

59:53.880 --> 59:55.280
After that, it's your call.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:11.920
You can do it, Jet!

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:13.880
Ake?

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:39.600
Khem!

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:48.520
Khem...

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.120
Are you alright?

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.000
Shit!

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.280
Who were they?

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:03.970
Jet!

01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:05.760
This way! Come on.

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:07.640
Thong?

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.480
Come on, Khem.

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:12.240
Hurry.

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:30.760
Rae,

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.240
if you can hear me,

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.480
follow my voice.

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.520
This body is waiting for you.

01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:44.600
She's not coming back.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.320
Who'd want to live

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.280
with a husband drowning in debt,

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.400
drinking all day, and beating his wife?

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:51.960
That's just another kind of death.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.480
Come back, Rae.

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.320
Handle your own problems.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.960
Don't use a spirit
to do your dirty work.

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:14.160
(Incanting)

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.880
(Incanting)

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:28.600
My lady won't spare you.

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:37.320
(Incanting)

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:48.640
Rae!

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:49.640
Rae...

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:52.200
Rae!

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.600
- Rae...
- Rae.

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:55.160
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:01.680
You've done nothing wrong.

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:02.920
I was a piece of shit.

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:05.200
Please forgive me.

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:08.280
From now on, I'll quit drinking

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:11.000
and focus on paying off my debts.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.840
Forgive me, Rae.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.440
I'm sorry, too.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:34.800
Thank you.

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.160
Rae and Worn managed to
rekindle their love

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:41.920
because of your help.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.000
It's too soon to say that.

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:48.120
Things are not that easy.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:51.600
- What do you mean?
- Jet,

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:56.360
wake Uncle Chai up
and take care of the rest.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:57.920
Yes, Master.

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.520
Follow me.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Master,

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:43.840
what did you mean it was too soon
to say they'd rekindled their love?

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:50.200
Even if Rae forgives Worn,

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:53.920
he won't really change.

01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:59.680
But he did make a promise.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:02.680
He did,

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:06.000
but that doesn't mean it'll happen.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.520
But I think they're trying.

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.480
After all, they still love each other.

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:21.280
Listen, Khem.

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:25.320
Love isn't always enough

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:29.520
to make things work.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.280
If being together
only leads to problems,

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.320
why bother?

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:00.880
Master,

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.160
you were willing to help Worn and Rae,

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:10.920
yet refused to help me.

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:17.400
Is it just because
I don't belong to this village?

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.400
My duty

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:27.640
is to take care
of the people in this village.

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.160
I'm an outsider.

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:45.680
I get it now.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:00.720
Still,

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:07.600
I'll do whatever it takes
to stop being an outsider in your eyes.

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:36.040
No touching.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.440
I'm sorry.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:11.920
Step up.

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:13.490
Oh, gosh...

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:15.240
- Slowly.
- Take it easy.

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.800
Careful. You'll bump into the door.

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:21.359
How did you end up like this?

01:08:22.439 --> 01:08:23.560
Take it easy.

01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:32.680
What have you been up to?

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:34.920
Save that for later.

01:08:35.439 --> 01:08:38.040
For now, let Charn get some rest.

01:08:50.319 --> 01:08:51.319
Right, Jet.

01:08:52.319 --> 01:08:55.479
I'll have those three guys
stay somewhere else for the time being.

01:08:56.319 --> 01:08:57.520
Thanks a lot, Uncle.

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.720
Don't worry about him.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.399
He'll be fine.

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:27.399
What? Why would I worry about him?

01:09:28.359 --> 01:09:30.160
He literally asked for trouble himself.

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:36.620
I'm leaving.

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:37.960
Good night.

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:07.440
Good luck.

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:09.560
Thank you so much.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:48.480
He came to say goodbye.

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.640
He's going to work in the city
for a while

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.280
to pay off his debts.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.920
He'll be apart from Rae for a bit.

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:05.920
See?

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.040
It's not that easy.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
So,

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:25.600
was the spirit that possessed Rae
someone from Khem's past karma?

01:11:33.250 --> 01:11:35.880
She sent her servant spirits
to harm the villagers.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:44.800
I'm sorry.

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:53.480
The spirit only stirred up
the resentment that was already there.

01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:59.480
Sooner or later, Worn and Rae
would've fallen apart anyway.

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:06.600
He's saying...

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.040
don't blame yourself.

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:09.840
It's not your fault.

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:20.440
- Right, Master...
- When your friend is with us,

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.200
you can drop the dialect.

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:29.320
Okay.

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:30.760
Well...

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:34.880
Is there any way I can see spirits again
like I did last night?

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:37.840
I still want another round with them.

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.160
Jet!

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.320
If I do that,

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.160
your parents will beat me up.

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:55.680
Right,

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:59.280
a spirit showed up
to save Khem last night.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:05.600
I caught a glimpse...

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.640
It looked like a man...

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:09.840
dressed in khaki.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Khem,

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:16.240
have you seen him before?

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:19.080
Yeah.

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:21.600
It's him

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:23.960
who keeps showing up.

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:20.640
Long time no see,

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:22.600
Wat.

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:05.960
Do you know that spirit?

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:06.720
It's none of your business.

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:07.600
You literally said,

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:08.760
"He's not the Khemmika you knew."

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.000
You talked about me, didn't you?

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.060
See that sign over there?

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:12.720
It used to be a viewpoint.

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:14.460
How about we pitch a tent
and do some stargazing tonight?

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:16.240
I've got a long-range rifle, baby!

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.880
Hey, are you done yet?

01:16:18.970 --> 01:16:19.660
Jet,

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:21.640
help Uncle Chai
gather the entire village.

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:24.160
We'll form search groups
to look for Te, Korn, and Phu.

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:25.280
They must be found before noon.

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:26.880
Why before noon?

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:28.840
If they're not found by noon,

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:29.880
we're looking for bodies.

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:37.560
♫No matter how long time's passed,
you still have me♫

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:42.640
♫Through storms and stars,
together we shall be♫

01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:47.720
♫Even if nightmares come,
we shall make them flee♫

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:52.520
♫With our hearts aligned,
we'll win gracefully♫

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:57.860
♫You still have me,
we're destined for eternity♫

01:16:57.900 --> 01:17:03.080
♫Through storms and stars,
together we shall be♫

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:08.200
♫Even if nightmares come,
we shall make them flee♫

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:19.840
♫With our hearts aligned,
we'll win triumphantly♫
