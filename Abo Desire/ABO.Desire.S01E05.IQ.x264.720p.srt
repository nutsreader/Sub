00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,890
We've made a police report.

175
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,330
No news of Mr. Hua so far.

176
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,830
Based on surveillance footage,

177
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,440
Mr. Hua got off work at 5:30 PM as usual.
He got into a ride-hailing car

178
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,270
in front of the company,

179
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,940
which drove to a surveillance blind spot

180
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,540
and never showed up again.

181
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,860
Checked the license plate?

182
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,680
Yes, it's a stolen car.

183
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,280
That's all we've got.

184
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,850
Sorry, Mr. Sheng.

185
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,280
It's my fault.

186
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,150
How so?

187
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,330
M-Mr. Sheng,

188
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,860
Mr. Hua might be in danger.

189
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,930
What danger?

190
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,070
Mr. Shen Wenlang of HS

191
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,300
values Mr. Hua a lot.

192
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,340
He brings him to every meeting.

193
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,900
To get more info about their R&D,

194
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,710
I...

195
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,110
I put a bug in Mr. Hua's briefcase.

196
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,480
Who told you to do that?

197
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,980
Sorry, Mr. Sheng.

198
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,850
-HS' security is airtight.
-Enough.

199
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,520
It doesn't matter now.

Do you have
the number of Shen's secretary?

203
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:37,530
Yes.

204
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,130
Call him!

205
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,130
Okay.

206
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:47,810
Hello.

207
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,040
This is the chairman's office of HS Group.

208
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,880
I'm Mr. Shen's secretary, Gao Tu.

209
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,910
How may I help you?

210
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,210
Hello, Mr. Gao.

211
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,150
Sheng Shaoyou of Shengfang Bio.

212
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,850
Mr. Gao.

213
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,020
Where is Mr. Shen?

214
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,370
Oh, hi, Mr. Sheng.

215
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,120
Mr. Shen is seeing a guest.

216
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,700
He isn't available.

217
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,360
I can relay a message to him for you.

218
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,400
Ask Shen Wenlang when he's free.

219
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,830
Tell me when he's free,

220
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,100
and I'll be right there.

221
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,030
Okay.

222
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,940
After his meeting,

223
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,800
I'll ask him

224
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,350
and get back to you.

225
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,370
Come in.

226
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,470
What's the matter?

227
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,930
Mr. Shen.

228
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,080
Don't just stand there like a statue.

229
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:43,960
I didn't hire you

230
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,690
to be an ornament in the office.

231
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,630
Besides,

232
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,300
you're not attractive enough to be one.

233
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,330
Mr. Gao.

234
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,470
I'm sorry.

235
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,050
I'm here to tell you

236
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,640
Mr. Sheng Shaoyou
from Shengfang Bio called.

237
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:09,950
What did he want?

238
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,920
He didn't elaborate.

239
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,960
He just

240
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,060
asked when you're free,

241
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,390
and he'll call again.

242
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:22,490
Just a few days without news of Hua Yong,
and he's this anxious.

243
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,700
What a loser.

244
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:25,670
He can't reach Mr. Hua?

245
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,839
Didn't Mr. Hua ask for leave?

246
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,300
Why do you know so much about Hua Yong?

247
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,840
You interested in him too?

248
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,310
Mr. Hua and I are in the same department.

249
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,570
No one knows his schedule better than me.

250
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,390
Besides,

251
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,520
there must be many people who care for

252
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,320
an outstanding Omega like him.

253
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,040
Omega this, Omega that.

254
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,970
Enough already.

255
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,760
If you lose focus

256
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,560
and make stupid mistakes again,

257
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,930
you can pack your things and go home.

258
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,570
Well,

259
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,910
about Mr. Sheng...

260
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,880
Let him wait.

261
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,980
Better if he loses his mind.

262
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,710
That bastard is so arrogant.

263
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,020
The first time we met,
he actually said 35 billion.

264
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,750
As if Shengfang Bio prints money.

265
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,280
About time he learns a lesson.

266
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,790
Don't ever answer his calls again.

267
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,360
Gao Tu.

268
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,930
You're my secretary,

269
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,300
not Sheng Shaoyou's messenger.

270
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,260
Get your head straight.

271
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,030
Don't cause me any trouble.

272
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,470
Yes, I got it.

273
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,150
Mr. Sheng,

274
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,620
I've called Allen,

275
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,420
the most famous private investigator
in Jianghu.

276
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,790
I'm sure there will be news
of Mr. Hua soon.

277
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,100
I'm really sorry.

278
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,400
It's all my fault.

279
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,790
I put the bug without your permission.

280
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,340
That's why...

281
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,600
It's not your fault.

282
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,610
I'm the one who told you
to prioritize results.

283
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,050
Really, it's my fault.

284
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,940
Please don't say that.

285
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,320
By the way,

286
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,320
Mr. Gao just called me

287
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,220
saying that Mr. Shen's busy

288
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,990
and won't be free anytime soon.

289
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,220
That bastard is clearly avoiding me.

290
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,100
I'll go to his office tomorrow morning.

291
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,630
Let's see where he can hide.

292
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,300
Rumor has it that

293
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,640
Mr. Shen was able to
connect with X Holdings

294
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,550
because he's involved with

295
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,920
the gang in Country P.

296
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,440
If he wants to,

297
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,410
it shouldn't be hard for someone like him

298
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,580
to hide Mr. Hua away.

299
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,460
Jianghu is a legal society.

300
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,690
If Hua Yong even so much as breaks a nail,

301
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,450
I'll kill Shen Wenlang.

302
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,060
So much for a legal society.

303
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,470
Mr. Sheng.

304
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,010
I feel terrible.

305
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,720
Mr. Sheng.

306
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,570
I want Mr. Sheng.

307
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,950
Mr. Sheng, I can't let you in.

308
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,040
Mr. Sheng, you can't go any further.

309
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,260
I really can't let you in.

310
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,590
Mr. Sheng, please stop.

311
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,790

312

Mr. Sheng.

313
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,680
Sorry, Mr. Shen is busy.

314
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,350
Whatever it is,

315
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,690
I can relay it for you.

316
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,420
Move.

317
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:39,750
I'm sorry.

318
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,990
You can't go in.

00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,530

321
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,040
Let him in.

323

Mr. Sheng.

324

Here unannounced
first thing in the morning.

325

What can I do for you?

326
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,290
Shen Wenlang, where is Hua Yong?

327
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,560
Oh.

328
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,990
So you're looking for someone.

329
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,130
But

330
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,630
shouldn't you go to the police?

331
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,880
This is a biotech company.

332
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,630
I'm afraid I can't help you.

333
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,600
Shen Wenlang, I'll ask you again.

334
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,140
Where is Hua Yong?

[HS Group]

336
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,810
Mr. Hua is on leave.

337
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,080
What?

338
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,980
Didn't he tell you?

339
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,950
I thought a guy like Hua Yong

340
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:43,550
would report everything
to his dear Mr. Sheng.

341
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,860
After all,

342
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,500
he even came to work with a bug.

343
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,460
He actually betrayed me

344
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,930
and the company

345
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,510
to help you steal classified info.

346
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:54,830
Why would he

347
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,800
hide his whereabouts from you

348
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,040
and make you worry?

349
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,480
Stealing classified info?

350
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,370
Yes.

351
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,880
I was shocked too.

352
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,250
But we caught him red-handed.

353
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,650
Can't doubt a fact.

354
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:14,950
My dog is

355
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,890
fed by me

356
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,560
but wagging his tail at another man.

357
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,020
Of course I need to teach him a lesson.

358
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,240
Mr. Shen.

359
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,970
Jianghu is a legal society.

360
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,910
Employers and employees are equals.

361
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,910
Hua Yong works for you,

362
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,240
but he's not your slave.

363
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,650
Where is he?

364
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,580
You'd better not drag this out.

365
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,290
Or else...

366
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,960
Or what?

367
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,030
You're influential in Jianghu.

368
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,590
But as you said,

369
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,590
Jianghu is a legal society.

370
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,760
Our HS operates legally.

371
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,770
Not illegal

372
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,390
nor in debt.

373
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,670
No matter how capable you are,

374
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,570
what can you do to me?

375
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:09,540
To be honest,

376
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,780
Mr. Hua and I are in love.

377
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,480
He chose me

378
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,340
and wants nothing to do with you anymore.

379
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,280
As we all know,

380
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,980
I hate Omegas.

381
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:23,410
But Hua Yong is the only one
who can get my attention.

382
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,490
His pheromones smell just like him.

383
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,330
Usually plain...

384
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,430
Hah.

385
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,300
But during a special period,

386
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,230
he's exceptionally passionate.

387
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,200
Oh.

388
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,000
You know,

389
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:46,320
he seemed to have a fever the first night.

390
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,840
He was delirious

391
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:50,700
and called out another Alpha's name
in front of me.

392
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,750
Mr. Sheng.

393
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:54,920
You know him so well.

394
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,710
Why don't you take a guess?

395
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,760
When he spent the night with me,

396
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,160
who do you think he called out for
while crying?

397
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,070
Just because you're an S-tier Alpha,

398
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,150
you come to my territory alone,

399
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,870
and always try to subdue me
with your pheromones.

400
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,140
What a bully.

401
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,020
Where is Hua Yong?

402
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,420
Give him back to me!

403
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,020
Now you feel for him?

404
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,990
As an S-tier Alpha,

405
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:37,330
you actually made an Omega
risk it for you.

406
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,520
Isn't it a bit late

407
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,900
for concern?

408
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,520
Mr. Sheng.

409
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,050
Mr. Shen.

410
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,690
Please calm down.

411
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,720
Let's talk things out.

412
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,020
Get lost.

413
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,990
Mr. Sheng.

414
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,330
Mr. Hua is really not in the company.

415
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:13,910
What Mr. Shen just said was out of anger.

416
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,130
Please contain your pheromones.

417
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,090
Fighting won't solve the problem.

418
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,640
Let's sit down and talk things out.

419
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,610
Don't waste your time with this fool.

420
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,080
Does he look rational enough

421
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,710
to have a sensible dicussion?

422
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,010
Crazy bastard.

423
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:28,910
Shen Wenlang!

424
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,850
Stop talking.

425
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,950
Contain your pheromones!

426
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,190
Shen Wenlang!

427
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,710
Let go of me!

428
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:43,830
Gao Tu.

429
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,830
Are you okay?

430
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,860
Throw this rabid dog out

431
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,900
of my company!

432
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,670
Shen Wenlang.

433
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,340
This is not over.

434
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,910
Prepare a car now.

435
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,650
Inhaler...

436
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,680
My inhaler.

437
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,020
What?

438
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,650
What did you say?

439
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,420
Give me my inhaler.

440
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,160
Inhaler?

441
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:16,690
For your asthma?

442
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,960
Yeah.

443
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,100
I'll help you find it.

444
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,230
Where is it?

445
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,370
No, I can do it myself.

446
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,410
Stay away from me.

447
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,180
You're a Beta,

448
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,640
not sensitive to pheromones.

449
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:39,480
Gosh,
you reek of Sheng Shaoyou's pheromones.

450
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,540
Damn it.

451
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,950
His pheromones sure stink.

452
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,230
No wonder you have an asthma attack.

453
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:50,360
Ugh! Don't move!

454
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,430
Is this it?

455
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,010
Go to Heci. Drive faster.

456
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,150
No.

457
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,020
Not Heci.

458
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,110
-It's the best hospital in the city.
-Mr. Shen.

459
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,290
Not Heci.

460
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,620
Where should we go then?

461
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:27,030
Mr. Shen, I'm not going to Heci.

462
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,890
I don't want my sister to worry.

463
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,600
Okay.

464
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,860
Where do you want to go?

465
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,960
To No. 7 Hospital.

466
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,980
That's where I always go.

467
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,380
Gao Tu.

468
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,820
Gao Tu!

469
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:47,850
Hey.

470
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,250
Did you witness the fight

471
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,700
between Mr. Shen and Mr. Sheng?

472
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,360
Gosh, it was so scary.

473
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,620
Mr. Gao got hospitalized
from mediating it.

474
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,220
Thank goodness he's a Beta
who isn't sensitive

475
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,470
to pheromones.

476
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,230
If it were a low-tier Alpha or an Omega

477
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,770
mediating two S-tier Alphas,

478
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,330
they could've died on the spot.

479
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,200
Of course.

480
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,600
I was scared to death.

481
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,210
But why did Mr. Sheng fight with Mr. Shen?

482
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,570
Why else?

483
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,940
Because of Mr. Hua.

484
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,160
What does this have to do with Mr. Hua?

485
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,780
Is there a misunderstanding?

486
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,810
Of course not.

487
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,680
Think about it.
Other than Mr. Hua,

488
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,950
does Mr. Shen ever interact with Omegas?

489
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,520
Mr. Shen even only drinks tea

490
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,920
made by Mr. Gao.

491
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,860
He avoids us Omegas

492
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,290
like the plague.

493
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,960
But doesn't Mr. Shen hate Omegas?

494
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,930
That's why I wondered about
his sexual orientation.

495
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,700
Now that you mention it,
the puzzle is complete.

496
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,200
Huh?

497
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,060
Think about it.

498
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,730
Mr. Shen hates Omegas,
and Mr. Sheng is an S-tier Alpha like him.

499
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,670
They're a perfect match.

500
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,470
Maybe they were already dating.

501
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,640
And now, Mr. Hua has come between them.

502
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,610
No wonder Mr. Sheng was fuming.

503
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:52,680
He stormed right here
and lashed out at Mr. Shen.

504
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,150
Two S-tier Alphas together?

505
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:57,090
You have such a crazy imagination.

506
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,960
Alright, stop chatting during work.

507
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,590
Go back to your seats.

508
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:20,980
Doctor.

509
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,680
Yes?

510
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,480
How is he?

511
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,380
He's better after the drip.

512
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,730
However,

513
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,210
his body is too weak.

514
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,730
He can't recover in a day or two.

515
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,560
He needs further treatment.

516
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:35,990
Wait.

517
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:39,530
Aren't you the Alpha
who spends all day with him

518
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:40,460
even though

519
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,400
you hate the scent of Omegas?

520
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,830
Yeah.

521
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,700
Oh.

522
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,870
Finally acting like
you care about him now?

523
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,840
Humph.

524
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,410
Why don't you just focus on

525
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,790
torturing him less?

526
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,850
Hating Omega's scent?

527
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:59,350
Just man up already.

528
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,020
Psycho.

529
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,620
You...

530
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,850
Who told you to be
so good at keeping secrets?

531
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,930
Leak news to let him know where I am.

532
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Mr. Sheng, the target is at X Hotel.

533
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,800
He seems to have an appointment.

534
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,470
Keep watching him.

535
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,100
Allen.

536
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,400
Be careful.

537
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,240
You must not alert them.

538
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,570
Don't worry, Mr. Sheng.

539
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,480
I'm the top private investigator

540
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:59,410
in Jianghu.

541
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:04,910
Mr. Sheng,

542
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:05,990
don't hang up.

543
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,350
Keep the line open.

544
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,360
Boss.

545
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,980
Boss, I'm sorry.

546
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,260
I'm sorry.

547
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,210
Sorry, Boss.

548
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,490
I-I-I'm sorry, Boss.

549
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,800
Sorry, Boss.

550
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,570
I'm sorry, Boss. I'm really sorry.

551
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,180
Boss, I didn't mean it.

552
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,780
I'm sorry.

553
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,680
Shut up.

554
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,150
You're hurting my ears.

555
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,920
Hello? Yes, got it.

556
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,310
What took you so long?

557
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,810
Something came up.

558
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,580
What's with your face?

559
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,820
Who hit you?

560
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,530
Who else could it be?

561
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:20,950
Sheng Shaoyou?

562
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,560
That rabid dog.

563
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,990
Even my secretary is in the hospital.

564
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,960
Damn my luck.

565
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,200
Listen.

566
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,970
Boss has only just calmed down.

567
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,370
He's in rut
and suffering mate-seeking compulsion.

568
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,100
You'd better watch your mouth.

569
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,970
Why should I baby him?

570
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,110
I even got a beating.

571
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,030
He's such a princess.

572
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,280
Sigh.

573
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,820
He got himself hurt all over
because of the mate-seeking compulsion.

574
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,790
Once he recovered a bit yesterday,

575
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,920
he started to deal with
the drug dealing of Country P.

576
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:58,700
Those who were just punished
are considered accomplices.

577
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,860
The six main culprits
who arrived yesterday

578
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,720
are all in the hospital,
four minors and two majors.

579
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,560
What are you talking about?

580
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,980
Four with minor injuries,
two serious injuries.

581
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,780
Holy.

582
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:14,840
Is he crazy?

583
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,909
So brutal.

584
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,480
It's not Boss' fault.

585
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,020
Someone used the new route to sell drugs

586
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,650
while Boss was away from HQ.

587
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,560
Super bold,

588
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:29,659
but not too smart.

589
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,790
The first batch was intercepted
before leaving the city.

590
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:35,400
If it were before,

591
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,469
Boss would've never let them leave alive.

592
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,750
Boss showing mercy? What a miracle.

593
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,940
Does Jianghu have good fengshui?

594
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:46,179
Hah.

595
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,710
Who knew there'd be such a day?

596
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:50,710
Who knows?

597
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,580
I heard

598
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,440
he's doing it for the man he loves.

599
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,420
Pfft.

600
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,920
Crazy.

601
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,060
We're here.

602
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,860
Once the door's open,

603
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,520
don't talk unless you have to.

604
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,710
Have you seen

605
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,450
the Omega in Room 9901?

606
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,750
That Omega with an orchid scent?

607
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,090
That pretty one.

608
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:33,290
He's obviously a good kid.

609
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,530
Gosh, what a pity.

610
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:36,590
Why?

611
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,560
That he is being

612
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:41,530
abused senseless by those violent Alphas.

613
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,100
Really?

614
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,270
I saw him from afar the day he moved in.

615
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,770
I didn't see his face clearly.

616
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,810
But an Omega who attracts so many Alphas

617
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,540
must be quite a looker.

618
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,210
Not just that.

619
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:58,010
That Omega is loose,

620
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:02,320
but he has an aloof face
like he has no urges.

621
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,490
If I were an Alpha,

622
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:04,920
if I saw him cry,

623
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,830
I'd do anything for him.

624
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,330
But Zhang from the night shift said

625
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,560
they go crazy in his suite.

626
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,960
A few nights ago,

627
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,530
he was covered in blood

628
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,530
and carried out by an executive.

629
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,720
Regardless of the business he's in,

630
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,910
it has to be a sin.

631
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:24,040
Why does a beauty like him
put himself through all that?

632
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,940
Leave him be.

633
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,670
Who knows? Maybe he's into it!

634
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,540
You saw it just now.

635
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,280
Just now, a bunch of Alphas

636
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,250
left his room all mighty.

637
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,150
A bunch of them!

638
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,050
You caught them in the act?

639
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,690
Not really.

640
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,520
Maybe I was mistaken.

641
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,530
Oh, come on. Stop lying to yourself.

642
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,760
How could you be wrong?

643
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,060
The 99th floor,

644
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:49,800
where X Holdings
receives VIPs exclusively.

645
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:53,270
Rich and powerful men
who can get whatever they want

646
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:56,010
are always looking for new thrills.

647
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:56,870
Besides,

648
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:01,810
with what goes on in Room 9901,

649
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:04,610
there must be many customers
who covet him.

650
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,120
If they take turns one at a time,

651
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,760
it will take forever.

652
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,990
So,

653
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,350
for efficiency,

654
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:13,390
appropriate overlapping is good news.

655
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:14,720
Many of his regular customers

656
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,030
are familiar with each other.

657
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,760
It's common for friends to engage in

658
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,000
group activities.

659
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:21,960
After all,

660
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,970
sharing an Omega is
also a kind of cooperation.

661
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,600
It shows their bond.

662
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,870
So you mean

663
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:33,400
he was covered in blood
because he was dealing with multiple...

664
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,510
-Multiple...
-Yes.

665
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:37,520
One Omega serving multiple Alphas,

666
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,410
entertaining them all at once.

667
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,910
Allen.

668
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,220
Bring him back.

669
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,020
W-What?

670
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,690
Allen, bring him back! Allen!

671
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,530
Allen!

672
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,860
Bring him back right now!

673
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,900
Mr. Sheng, I hear you just fine.

674
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,500
Please don't shout.

675
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,230
I don't want to be deaf.

676
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,870
As long as you bring him back,

677
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,730
name whatever price you want.

678
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,840
I'll owe you a favor for life.

679
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,580
Okay, don't worry.

680
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,790
Boqiao, have you been to X Hotel?

681
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,380
What's wrong, Shaoyou?

682
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,700
You sound off.

683
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,830
Cut the crap and answer me.

684
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,530
I'd been there a long time ago.

685
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:35,500
But not often. My brother didn't let me.

686
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,900
That is Country P's turf.

687
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,570
They're super wild, different from us.

688
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:40,660
My brother was worried
I'd be taken advantage of.

689
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,030
But I heard the new owner of X Holdings

690
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,420
made adjustments.

691
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,480
I don't know the details, though.

692
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,300
Shen Wenlang.

693
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,930
Shen Wenlang.

694
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:06,100
Shen Wenlang!

695
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,700
How dare you...

696
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,840
You're out of your mind!

697
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,760
After beating our men up like crazy,

698
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,700
how's he sleeping like a baby?

699
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,410
Get up.

700
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,210
Wenlang.

701
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,080
Get up!

702
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,320
So noisy.

703
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:00,350
Shen Wenlang.

704
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,490
Did the sky collapse?

705
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,360
The sky's fine.

706
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,990
But Wenlang was

707
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,530
beaten up by Sheng Shaoyou.

708
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,900
I warned you to be careful

709
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,540
since he can get

710
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,200
aggressive.

711
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,200
Did you fight back?

712
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,110
Of course!

713
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,150
I was being attacked!

714
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:31,920
You hurt him?

715
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,620
It's self-defense, get it?

716
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,420
No.

717
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,730
Where did you hurt him?

718
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,530
He wanted to strangle me,

719
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,760
so I kicked him.

720
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,530
Just one kick.

721
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:03,980
Mm.

722
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,770
Are you crazy?

723
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,700
How can you blame me for that?

724
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,840
I'll let this go.

725
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,350
You're inexperienced.

726
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,890
Be careful next time.

727
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:50,000
Don't hurt Mr. Sheng again.

728
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,640
There won't be a next time.

729
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,440
Hua Yong.

730
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,540
Do you think I enjoy this?

731
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:06,210
I'm repaying you for your help
when I started my business.

732
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,650
You're also my partner in HS.

733
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:11,450
Or else, do you think
I'd get involved in this drama?

734
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:13,820
Sheng Shaoyou is a dumb masochist
clinging onto you,

735
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:14,820
but I'm not dumb.

736
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,090
If it weren't for your stupid plot,

737
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:18,350
would I've got beat up?

738
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,560
Wenlang,

739
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,530
being grateful is a great quality.

740
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,630
I helped you, so you helped me.

741
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,280
If you need my help

742
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,600
in the future,

743
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,970
we can make a deal again.

744
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,340
Fair exchange of good karma.

745
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,210
Fair exchange of good karma?

746
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,250
Then could you please do me a favor

747
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:46,050
and be gentler
when you teach the subordinates a lesson?

748
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:48,550
Leave some men intact
for me and Chang Yin.

749
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,660
Anyone who leaves your room

750
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:53,190
becomes incapacitated and can't work.

751
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:55,690
Those guys from yesterday

752
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,630
are still lying in the ICU.

753
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,100
No, I can't.

754
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,100
Sigh.

755
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,070
Wenlang.

756
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,400
With a few losers
who want in on the drug business gone,

757
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,740
the world still keeps spinning, no?

758
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,010
You know

759
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,550
how much effort it took me

760
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,680
to bring the sinking ship
of Beichao Holdings ashore.

761
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,220
Anyone who wants to dirty my deck

762
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,790
has to be killed.

763
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:26,420
It's reasonable.

764
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:32,350
If anyone dares to do such business again,

765
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,690
I'll kill them right away.

766
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,870
You don't have to dirty your hands.

767
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,700
That's the spirit.

768
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:41,110
I know

769
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,080
your and Chang Yin's job
of managing the men isn't easy.

770
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:44,880
But Wenlang,

771
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,580
I showed them mercy.

772
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:48,700
After a few whips,

773
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,840
I let them go with their limbs intact.

774
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,620
Why're you still complaining?

775
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,050
Just a few whips?

776
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:55,750
A few more whips

777
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,180
would've killed them.

778
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:59,930
I didn't use much force.

779
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:02,860
If this kills them,

780
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:05,930
they're to blame for being too weak.

781
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,860
Alright, Wenlang.

782
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:11,260
Boss has left them a way out

783
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,670
to turn over a new leaf.

784
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,710
It's their blessing.

785
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:18,180
Don't cross the line
by getting involved with drugs.

786
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,640
Discipline your men.

787
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:21,720
Don't let me down again.

788
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:23,980
Yes, sir.

789
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:25,380
Hey.

790
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:28,640
Have you leaked the news

791
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,780
I asked you to?
