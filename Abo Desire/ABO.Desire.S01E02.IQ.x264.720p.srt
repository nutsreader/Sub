00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,550
I have a meeting
tomorrow morning, I'm leaving.

172
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,350
Shaoyou,

173
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,510
don't leave yet.

174
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,720
Mr. UKW

175
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,190
might be on his way here. Just wait.

176
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,390
What UKW?

177
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,990
That mystery guy behind X Holdings.

178
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,560
He controls Country P's market,

179
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,600
but never shows his face.

180
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,100
You know who.

181
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,400
Boring, I'm leaving.

182
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,940
Hey, Shaoyou.

183
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,470
You haven't hung out in ages!

184
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,210
Stay a bit longer.

185
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,370
Let me tell you.

186
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,580
I've got some juicy intel for you.

187
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,580
It's all about that mystery guy.

188
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,850
Is your intel reliable?

189
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,750
Of course.

190
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,020
It came from my brother's
cooperative partner in Country P.

191
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,360
It's 100% reliable.

192
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,350
Apparently, X Holdings
used to be called Beichao Holdings.

193
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,160
The current person in charge
is the youngest son

194
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,890
of Beichao Holdings' founder,

195
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,630
and he's an illegitimate kid.

196
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,940
I heard he's not even 30 yet.

197
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,800
But don't let the age fool you.

198
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,740
He was the one who turned

199
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,400
Beichao Holdings
from a local giant in Country P

200
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,540
into a global titan

201
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,880
with branches all over the world.

202
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,080
They say this mystery man
has a strange personality.

203
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,750
He's extremely lowkey

204
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,010
and never socializes.

205
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,320
No one knows

206
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,120
what he looks like
except his confidant.

207
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,390
And there's something even weirder.

208
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,490
What is it?

209
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,530
It is said that

210
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,590
the first thing he did
after taking over the company...

211
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,740
was rename Beichao Holdings

212
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,040
to something totally bizarre, X.

213
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,450
Come on, cheers.

214
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,160
Come on, let's drink.

215
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,160
Hey.

216
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,770
Hold on.

217
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,270
How can I help you?

218
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,540
Sit here and have a drink with me.

219
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,210
Sorry.

220
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,340
I don't drink.

221
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,580
You work in a place like this,

222
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,110
and you say you don't drink?

223
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,520
Don't worry.
I'll give you tips after this.

224
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,520
Sorry,

225
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,680
I need to serve drinks in other rooms.

226
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,160
Excuse me.

227
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,930
Have fun.

228
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,830
Now in Country P,

229
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:43,330
the X family's so rich
that they could buy the entire country.

230
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,260
They run the game with an iron fist.

231
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,430
Why did he change its name?

232
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,500
Who knows?

233
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,710
They say "X" stands for mystery.

234
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,310
He renamed the company to match the fact

235
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,580
that Mr. UKW never shows his face.

236
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,020
Is that so? Maybe it stands for dumb.

237
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,920
Shaoyou,

238
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,460
you still hate illegitimate kids, right?

239
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,860
In my opinion,

240
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,960
people can't choose their birth or looks,

241
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,960
so the kids shouldn't be blamed.

242
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,770
My brother's cooperative partner
in Country P

243
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,470
has a few major deals with X Holdings.

244
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,640
That Mr. UKW is sharp, calculating,

245
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,610
and smart.

246
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,940
He's a top-tier talent.

247
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,620
No wonder he can easily

248
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,820
beat all the other heirs of that old man.

249
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,350
People also say

250
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,960
that Mr. UKW doesn't socialize
because he’s ugly,

251
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,760
and that's why he hides his face.

252
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,030
Isn't it good not to see people?

253
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,570
A rat in the gutter
should stay in the gutter.

254
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,870
An illegitimate kid like him,

255
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:57,130
even if he climbs to the top,
he still has to hide in the dark.

256
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,070
What a shameful person.

257
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,040
Shaoyou,

258
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,870
if you hate illegitimate kids that mcuh,

259
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,750
why are you trying to get close
to X Holdings' person in charge?

260
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,590
I keep business and personal separate.

261
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,720
If it's necessary,

262
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,650
let alone an illegitimate kid,

263
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,290
as long as it's profitable,

264
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,590
even cats can do business with rats.

265
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,460
Shaoyou,

266
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,600
are you heading home alone tonight again?

267
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,870
Are you sure
you don't want to bring a cutie with you?

268
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,910
Listen,

269
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,910
I'm very generous, you know.

270
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,640
You can pick one first.

271
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,950
No thanks. Keep them for yourself.

272
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,850
Guys with mysophobia are so picky.

273
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,980
Picking up an Omega at a club

274
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,620
won't kill you, right?

275
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,190
Enough.

276
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,190
It looks like tonight

277
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,590
the X Holdings fool isn't showing up.

278
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,390
I'm leaving.

279
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,920
Enjoy yourself.

280
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:05,050
[Aquarius]

281
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,670
You're too cute to just serve drinks.

282
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,240
Have fun with me.

283
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,610
[Sagittarius]

284
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,540
I'm very rich!

285
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,810
Name your price.

286
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,210
I'm sorry. I really can't.

287
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,780
[Sagittarius]

288
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,010
Hey.

289
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,350
You can't?

290
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,010
Don't play innocent with me.

291
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,350
Don't piss me off.

292
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,270
[Aquarius]

293
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,010
[Sagittarius]

294
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,590
Mr. Sheng.

295
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,660
Help me.

296
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,830
A little Omega dares to reject me?

297
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,350
What's going on?

298
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,720
It looks like two Alphas

299
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,950
fighting over one Omega.

300
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,420
That Alpha is releasing
the dominance pheromones.

301
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,160
Oh my!

302
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,380
He's an S-tier Alpha!

303
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,840
Shut the door, quick!

304
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,250
Here, Mr. Sheng.

305
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,450
I'm the OPS manager of Royal Sky Club.

306
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,250
I sincerely

307
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,260
apologize

308
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,590
for tonight's trouble.

309
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,630
Hua, why are you just standing here?

310
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,790
You caused such a scene on your first day.

311
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,790
Hurry up and apologize to Mr. Sheng.

312
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,330
Sorry, Mr. Sheng.

313
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,600
I...

314
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,140
No need to apologize.

315
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,110
A rude customer brought you bad luck.

316
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,630
But being unlucky is not your fault.

317
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,070
You're absolutely right, Mr. Sheng.

318
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,910
In our service industry,

319
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,420
it's rare to meet someone like you

320
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,520
who's willing to step up for others.

321
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,920
Hua is lucky enough

322
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,020
to have your help.

323
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,520
Isn't this place supposed to be

324
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,760
the most famous club in Jianghu?

325
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,890
What's with the bandit-style customer?

326
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,819
How can you accept a thug like that?

327
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,270
What's wrong with your boss, Zheng Yushan?

328
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,369
Is he really that desperate for money?

329
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:13,200
No, no, no.

330
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,599
Mr. Sheng, please let me explain.

331
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,640
What happened today

332
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,140
was just a small misunderstanding.

333
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,010
Our boss Mr. Zheng

334
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:18,940
often mentions you.

335
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,670
He says whenever

336
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,410
Mr. Sheng visits Royal Sky Club,

337
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,280
we must provide the best service.

338
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,780
We've already handed

00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,350
Sorry, doctor.

506
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,520
Thank you.

507
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,020
I'll try everything to get the money.

508
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,770
-That cufflink...
-HS's salary...

509
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,940
It seems like
your company treats you quite badly.

510
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,540
Secretary Hua,
you go to work in the morning,

511
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,550
flirt with the boss at night,

512
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,520
and even serve drinks
at a club after midnight.

513
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,780
You're working that hard,
yet you still can't get 600,000?

514
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,910
Instead of being an escort
at Royal Sky Club,

515
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,360
why not just steal a watch
off Shen Wenlang's wrist?

516
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,420
That alone's worth more than 60,000.

517
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,770
Mr. Sheng,

518
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:43,070
I work part-time as a waiter at that club,

519
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,200
but I don't do escort work.

520
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,510
And Mr. Shen and I are just coworkers.

521
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,550
Last night, when I asked for your number,

522
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,710
I didn't mean anything else.

523
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,840
I just wanted to return your cufflink.

524
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,350
Could you not assume the worst of me?

525
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,550
So they're just coworkers.

526
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,300
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

527
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,750
Do you remember
what that doctor just said?

528
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,250
What was his sister's bed number again?

529
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,150
Bed 291.

Hello, this is the bill for bed 291.

00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,630
Could you please...

533
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,170
delay the payment for me?

534
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,800
I'll pay it back as soon as I can.

535
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,260
There's no outstanding balance
for bed 291.

536
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,240
In fact, 600,000 yuan was already prepaid

537
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,570
for the surgery and post-op care.

538

What? Prepaid?

539
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,810
Yes. You're the family
of the patient in bed 291, right?

540
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,610
Your friend already covered it.

He's a tall, handsome S-tier Alpha.

547
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,690
He paid a large sum of money,

548
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,030
so I double-checked
the bed number several times with him.

It can't be wrong.

About the afternoon meeting,

Anything else?

Thank you, Mr. Shen,
for helping pay for my sister's surgery.

I promise I'll pay you back.

-You're welcome.

Whether you repay me or not
doesn't matter.

bring over an Omega with floral scent?

671
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,429
What are you waiting for?

672
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
Come on, hurry up.

673
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,510
Sorry, Mr. Sheng.

674
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,440
You said it's just a meal with friends.

675
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,600
I didn't expect something so formal.

676
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,580
If it's not appropriate,

677
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,780
I can leave right now.

678
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,949
Leave? Why?

679
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,570
You look just fine.

680
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,640
Hasn't Shen Wenlang
ever brought you to events like this?

681
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:15,780
Nope.

682
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,480
I just started working for him.

683
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,680
Mr. Shen usually brings Secretary Gao.

684
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,960
So today is your first time?

685
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,500
Yes.

686
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,590
Hello, Mr. Sheng.

687
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,200
Mr. Sheng.

688
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,600
Maybe I should go.

689
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,090
Why?

690
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,900
Because I'm not dressed properly.

691
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,340
What do you mean?

692
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,200
You might lose reputation because of me.

693
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,510
Well,

694
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,380
now that you mention it,
a little bit, yeah.

695
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,790
Then... I'll leave now.

696
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,650
I'll treat you to a meal next time.

697
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:01,930
You're already here.

698
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,060
And I've got a pretty big reputation,

699
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,390
even if you cost me a bit of it,
I'll be fine.

700
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,730
You can treat me
to a meal some other time.

701
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,270
But...

702
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,270
No buts.

703
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,910
You've already embarrassed me
with what you're wearing.

704
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:17,240
If you ditch me now
and let me walk in alone,

705
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,750
that'd be even worse.

706
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:21,250
Let's go.

707
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,980
This time, let's for get it.

708
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,850
But next time I invite you to a meal,

709
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,450
make sure to dress properly.

710
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,990
There won't be a next time, right?

711
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,120
No next time?

712
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:32,790
Yeah...

713
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:34,730
Mr. Sheng,

714
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,690
I don't have any other decent clothes.

715
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:39,970
That's easy to fix.

716
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:43,330
I'll have Chen Pinming
take you shopping sometime.

717
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,970
Shaoyou, I've been looking for you.

718
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:48,170
Why don't you come in?

719
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,610
Let's go.

720
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,050
Okay.

721
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,460
Here, try this.

722
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,390
Okay, thank you.

723
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,060
Here, have some more.

724
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,600
Yushan, I think next time

725
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,570
we should meet at your club.

726
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,740
No problem.
You can go to our club next time.

727
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,670
I'll arrange it.

728
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,870
Darn it.

729
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,610
I throw parties like this every week,

730
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,010
but they're never this lively without you.

731
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,210
I didn't get a chance to ask earlier.

732
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,880
Who is this?

733
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,150
He looks unfamiliar.

734
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,150
I don't think we've met before, huh?

735
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,260
I haven't seen you in a while,

736
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,820
where did you find this gem?

737
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,130
It's none of your business.

738
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,080
He also has the floral scent.

739
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,540
Hey, relax!

740
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,640
I'm sorry.

741
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:57,740
I mean...

742
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,850
I was just taking a whiff.

743
00:37:58,850 --> 00:37:59,710
Don't get mad, okay?

744
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,410
Alright, Boqiao, stop it.

745
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:03,010
He's an Omega.

746
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,450
Behave yourself.

747
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,220
Don't scare off our new friend.

748
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:06,890
Fine.

749
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,390
I won't get too close.

750
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,260
Can I at least ask your name?

751
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,260
Hua Yong.

752
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,400
You are Hua Yong?

753
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,260
The one who got Sheng Shaoyou

754
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,200
to answer an unknown call?

755
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,800
I've heard a lot about you.

756
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,940
You're harassing my friend to my face now?

757
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,810
Li Boqiao,

758
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,210
can you act like a normal person?

759
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,340
Come on, I've hit on

760
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,940
your other friends before.

761
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,880
Why are you overreacting today?

762
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,350
Can't I sniff on him?

763
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,460
A little touch
won't cost him a finger anyway.

764
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,690
Boqiao.

765
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,560
Shaoyou barely comes to these gatherings.

766
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,360
If you keep this up,

767
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,700
he won't come again.

768
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,800
Fine.

769
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,100
I'll keep my hands off his gem.

770
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:56,230
How about this?

771
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,700
Let's drink.

772
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,360
We can still drink, right?

773
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,740
-Okay. Come on.
-Come on.

774
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,090
You're drunk.

775
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,570
It's not safe for you to go home alone.

776
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:35,570
Let me see you off.

777
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,750
By the way, Mr. Sheng,

778
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,880
Here's my repayment plan.

779
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:31,440
[Repayment Plan]

780
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,640
I know...

781
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,310
it may take a long time,

782
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,710
and the interest is low.

783
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,310
Technically, I don't have any collateral,

784
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,770
so I should be paying
more than the bank rate.

785
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,920
But once I pay off the principal,

786
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,920
I'll keep paying interest

787
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,920
at four times the bank's rate,

788
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,850
until everything's fully repaid.

789
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:12,100
There's a faster way, you know.

790
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,710
Sorry.

791
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,350
I don't have much salary.

792
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,780
Before I get promoted and get a raise,

793
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,250
this is already the fastest I can get.

794
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:30,820
Hua Yong,

795
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:36,310
be my partner.

796
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,130
If you say yes,

797
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,320
you don't have to pay me anything.

798
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,440
Sorry.

799
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,110
Mr. Sheng.

800
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,510
It might take a while,

801
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,410
but I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

802
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:58,150
Okay.

803
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,580
Shaoyou.

804
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,580
That Hua Yong you brought tonight,

805
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,190
I really liked him.

806
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,580
If you guys ever break up,

807
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,920
just let me know.

808
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,080
I wouldn't mind it.

809
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,250
Mr. Sheng, I'm here.

810
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:02,940
I'll walk you upstairs.

811
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,090
No need.

812
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:08,380
This alley is not safe,

813
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,750
I'm afraid your shoes might get dirty.

814
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,130
Okay.

815
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,140
I'll leave now.
