1
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,500
I'll be off now

2
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,100
See you

3
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,039
Mr. Sheng

4
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,170
Yes?

5
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,340
When you’re free, please let me know

6
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,380
I still owe you that dinner

7
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,410
Go home

8
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,550
It’s late and cold

9
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:05,850
OK

10
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,150
Mr. Sheng

11
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,590
Good night

12
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,940
Mr. Sheng

13
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,680
this is Miss Shu’s expense statement for the month

14
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,450
She spent a total of 1.24 million

15
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,020
All charged under your name

16
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,530
And what’s this?

17
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,030
It’s

18
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,800
from Secretary Hua and he asked me to pass it to you

19
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,150
He’s really serious about repaying the money

20
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,790
He said he’s very grateful for your help

21
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,090
He’ll do everything he can to pay you back soon

22
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,190
Who asked him to hurry

23
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,990
Who knows how much he had to scrimp and save to come up with this

24
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,560
Twenty thousand?

25
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,829
That wouldn’t even cover the silverware on one of Shu Xin’s handbags

26
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,270
There are far easier ways to repay me

27
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,140
yet he insists on going the hardest route

28
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,470
Stubborn idiot

29
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,180
Mr. Sheng

30
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,480
Yes?

31
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,490
The research team has put together an updated proposal

32
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,820
on the targeted drug development

33
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,360
A few years ago

34
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,260
X Holdings’ lab published a paper on their LYTAC technology

35
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,000
which uses the lysosomal degradation pathway for protein targeting

36
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,640
Our direction has been trying to build on that

37
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,640
to develop

38
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,010
an autophagy-based targeted chimera degradation technology

39
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,010
specifically for the pheromone glandular carcinoma

40
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,680
Unfortunately, we haven’t had any breakthroughs

41
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,180
X Holdings leveraged autophagy pathways

42
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,720
to develop AUTAC

43
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,460
and even more advanced, ATTEC targeted degradation technologies

44
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,730
These two

45
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,800
are considered their most critical and classified core technologies

46
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,700
in their drug development pipeline for AAS gland cancer

47
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,030
Originally

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,540
X Holdings is the original inventor of this tech

49
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,409
Trying to catch up to them

50
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,740
we are facing a serious gap in both tech and talents

51
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,580
And HS Group holds the exclusive license to X Holdings’ confidential technology

52
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,720
They're leveraging the foundation

53
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,920
built by industry giants to gain broader vision

54
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:54,990
Mr. Sheng

55
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,220
should we consider poaching talent from HS Group?

56
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,860
Throw enough money at a problem, and risk-takers will line up

57
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,230
It’s difficult. Shen Wenliang treasures talent.

58
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,400
HS Group’s equity incentive system

59
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,840
isn’t any worse than ours at SHENGFANG Biotech

60
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,100
Even if we spend a fortune to poach people

61
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,040
we’d likely just get some irrelevant staff

62
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,110
and end up alerting them

63
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,040
Not be worth the effort

64
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,540
We’ll wait and see now

65
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,180
Yes

66
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,850
Mr. Sheng

67
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,380
should we consider starting with Hua Yong?

68
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,520
I heard that although he only recently joined

69
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,290
Shen Wenliang trusts him a lot

70
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,390
He even brings him along to board-level decision-making meetings

71
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,200
Trusted?

72
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,430
If he were truly trusted

73
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,070
how could he not even afford his sister’s medical bills?

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,270
Na?ve

75
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,940
Let’s not get into risky business like recruiting spies

76
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,370
Mr. Sheng, did you receive the 20,000 I repaid?

77
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,490
Mr. Sheng

78
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,090
Yes

79
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,290
What are you doing?

80
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,260
You look like you’re sneaking around

81
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,230
Waiting for Mr. Shen to finish a meeting

82
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,560
This late

83
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,430
Humph

84
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,830
Shen Wenliang sure knows how to make use of people

85
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,100
pays you peanuts

86
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,600
but works you to the bone

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,110
Mr. Sheng, about the money I paid back, did you not receive it?

88
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,140
What money?

89
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,780
I asked Secretary Chen to give it to you

90
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,880
That brown envelope

91
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:00,980
Oh

92
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,910
That one

93
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,480
Did you receive it?

94
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,020
Nope

95
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,720
You repaid me?

96
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,220
I didn’t even know

97
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,320
That can’t be

98
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,390
Secretary Chen promised he’d pass it on

99
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,560
Hua Yong

100
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,260
what time do you get off work

101
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,800
In half an hour

102
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,770
Hard to explain over the phone

103
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,800
I’ll swing by and pick you up

104
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,070
and talk in person

105
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:27,910
Umm

106
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:28,710
OK

107
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,630
Why are you standing there? Get in

108
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,170
Mr. Sheng, about that money

109
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:01,870
Oh?

110
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,110
That

111
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,410
Chen Pinming just messaged me

112
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,380
Said he forgot to give it to me earlier

113
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,110
He’ll pass it along tomorrow at work

114
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,820
Thanks god

115
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,290
Oh right

116
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:16,750
next month

117
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,890
when I get paid

118
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,420
I’ll send over the next repayment

119
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,760
No need

120
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,660
Once every six months is fine

121
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,330
How much you repay each time

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,130
it’s up to you

123
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,630
That amount means nothing to me

124
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,200
But

125
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,470
But what?

126
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,110
Doesn’t your sister still need further treatment

127
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:36,409
You’ll need money for all that

128
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,510
If you give it all back to me

129
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,539
how are you going to pay for her care?

130
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,679
Then?

131
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,750
Beg the doctor again to give you more time?

132
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,020
Thank you, Mr. Sheng

133
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,260
Hua Yong

134
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,000
Yes?

135
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,950
Are you hot?

136
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,390
Why is your face so red

137
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,460
Oh

138
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,590
I’m not hot

139
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,730
By the way, Mr. Sheng

140
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,140
Yup?

141
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,070
May I

142
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,140
add you on Wechat?

143
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,780
Mm

144
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,910
Sure

145
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,090
Thank you

146
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,060
Come on

147
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,600
I’ll take you home

148
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,850
Mr. Sheng, thank you for taking me home

149
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,820
Be careful on the way back

150
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,790
OK

151
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,040
You’re the new tenant in 106, right?

152
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,600
Getting off work this late

153
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,300
Yeah

154
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,340
The guy who dropped you off just now is your friend?

155
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,110
He was nice to bring you home so late

156
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,550
He is

157
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,050
He’s pretty nice

158
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,880
Not bad

159
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,090
You have a lot of well-off friends

160
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,220
Last time, the guy who helped you move in

161
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,660
looked like he is rich too

162
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,310
Hello, Mr. Sheng

163
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,210
This is Hua Yong

164
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,550
Did you get home safely?

165
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,120
Mr. Sheng

166
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:49,630
Also, please take a look at this

167
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,270
Here’s the plan from earlier

168
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,900
Everyone

169
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,140
that concludes today’s meeting summary

170
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,610
Meeting adjourned

171
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,240
Get back to work

172
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,540
Okay

173
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,710
Let’s go

174
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,780
I'm at the office

175
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,530
Morning, Mr. Sheng

176
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,990
I baked some cookies this morning

177
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,260
and had them delivered to your company’s front desk

178
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,500
I wasn’t sure what flavors you liked

179
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,000
so I made the original ones

180
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,970
I hope you don’t mind

181
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,400
and enjoy them

182
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,980
Go pick up some cookies from the front desk

183
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,540
Someone sent them for me

184
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,650
Cookies?

185
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,380
Yup

186
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,880
But don’t you usually avoid sweets?

187
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,650
It’s fine to have a couple now and then

188
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,650
Understand

189
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,190
I’ll bring them to your office shortly

190
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,790
Umm

191
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,350
Here’s today’s second home-made cookies

192
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,950
The first batch

193
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,720
burned a bit

194
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,190
from temp control issues

195
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,420
But I didn’t waste them

196
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,860
I ate them all

197
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:25,900
Mm

198
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,540
Burnt cookies aren’t good to eat

199
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,740
They’re carcinogenic

200
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,110
No worries

201
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,240
I made sure to spit out all the really burnt bits

202
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,720
Some say that

203
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,420
human affection is like muscle

204
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,790
both can be trained into existence

205
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,390
The method is

206
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,260
pushing boundaries relentlessly

207
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,130
then offer sweetness

208
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,000
after each retreat

209
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,900
When someone who despises sweets

210
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,000
begins tolerating sweetness for you

211
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,870
That is

212
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,840
Love’s first tremor

213
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,160
Help

214
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,430
Set the alarm wrong

215
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,630
Overslept

216
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,830
Took the wrong subway line

217
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,370
and was exactly one minute late

218
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,440
Bye my attendance bonus

219
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,510
Visited my sister today

220
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,110
She's much better after the surgery

221
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,380
Hope she recovers quickly

222
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,450
His mouth is sharp

223
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,680
but his heart’s softer than clouds

224
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,120
Thank you

225
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,690
My Mr. X

226
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,630
Why does he post everything on social media?

227
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,560
Idiot

228
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,600
What is he, first year in school?

229
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:24,750
Where are the cookies?

230
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,820
No cookies for a whole week

231
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,360
Has student Hua Yong gotten too much homework?

232
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,060
Cookie attendance rate is dangerously low

233
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,860
Did the flour factory shut down?

234
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,240
Good morning, Mr. Sheng

235
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,310
Sorry, I was really tired yesterday

236
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,710
and fell asleep early

237
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,510
Been a bit busy lately

238
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,150
working overtime and trying to move

239
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,720
What about you?

240
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,720
Are you on the way to work now?

241
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,890
Why haven’t you been baking cookies lately?

242
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,360
Mr. Sheng, I’m preparing to move

243
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,260
Might crash at a friend’s place temporarily

244
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,860
Won’t be convenient to use their kitchen

245
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,900
so no cookies for a while maybe

246
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,270
Which friend?

247
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,180
Why are you moving?

248
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,280
Oh

249
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,420
My old neighborhood is getting demolished

250
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,890
My landlord gave me three days to move out

251
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,220
When did this happen

252
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,720
Last week

253
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,060
Where are you right now?

254
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:14,990
At my friend’s apartment

255
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,030
Housing in the city center is hard to find

256
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,099
Been looking at places with an agent

257
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,200
but nothing suitable yet

258
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,230
The landlord already changed the locks

259
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,670
Said whenever I can move

260
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,400
She’ll come and unlock the door

261
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,470
Sorry, Mr. Sheng

262
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,840
I guess you’ll have to wait for your cookies

263
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,080
until I’m settled

264
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,440
Hua Yong

265
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,180
Yes?

266
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,780
How can you let people walk all over you like this?

267
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,650
You’re never like this with me

268
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,450
If your landlord won’t open the door

269
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,750
you just give up?

270
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,950
What, are all the locksmiths in JIANGHU disappeared?

271
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,320
Mm

272
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,960
Mr. Sheng

273
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,960
He didn’t give permission

274
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,730
I can’t just break in with a locksmith

275
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,200
Don’t teach the little pumpkin bad things

276
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,400
Then, my little pumpkin

277
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,860
what about your lease?

278
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,970
It’s expired

279
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,870
The landlord doesn’t have to renew it

280
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,340
and he stopped taking rent

281
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,240
But

282
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,270
my deposit’s still with him

283
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,880
Since I didn’t move out in time

284
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,240
I probably won’t get it back

285
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,380
Forget the deposit

286
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,480
I’ve got a vacant apartment

287
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,710
near your company

288
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,980
Do you want to rent it?

289
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,620
Huh?

290
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,090
Your apartment must be super expensive

291
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,320
Not really

292
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,990
It’s just sitting empty anyway

293
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,320
I only charge you thirty thousand

294
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,620
Four bedrooms

295
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,390
includes maintenance fees and two parking lots

296
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,330
Interested?

297
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,200
Mr. Sheng

298
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,270
That’s way too expensive. I can’t afford it

299
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,000
What’s your budget?

300
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,540
Two thousand

301
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,700
Per week?

302
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,010
Per month

303
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:39,880
Great

304
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,680
Two thousand it is

305
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,310
I’ll send you the address and door code later

306
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,420
You’re moving in after work today

307
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,480
I’ll pick you up

308
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:47,380
Ah

309
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,520
that’s not really okay

310
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,790
Don’t worry

311
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,220
30k to 2k is too big a difference, isn't it?

312
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,420
The place is empty anyway

313
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,530
I hire a cleaner every month

314
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,000
you can move in and take over the cleaning

315
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,000
Consider it rent

316
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,030
That still isn't enough

317
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,970
Our corporate hub's nearby

318
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,640
When I work late

319
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,310
you'd cook midnight snacks

320
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,140
to offset the rest of your rent

321
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,480
This feels inappropriate

322
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,650
Why?

323
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,350
Don't trust me alone with you?

324
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,780
It’s not that

325
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,690
I trust you, Mr. Sheng

326
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,190
I just hate owing more favors

327
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,190
Feeling not that well

328
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,060
Nothing

329
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,000
Debts weigh nothing when piled high

330
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,260
Just accept it

331
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,400
Hua Yong

332
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:36,630
Need it or not?

333
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,500
You owe favors to friends anyway

334
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,440
Might as well owe them to me

335
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,810
Wouldn't want a pupil getting confused with keeping the aacounts

336
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,950
Thank you, Mr. Sheng

337
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,550
No worries

338
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,150
I'll send the address and the door code soon

339
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,680
and pick you up after work

340
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,480
to help you move

341
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,260
Youth these days

342
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,930
Moving in and out like stray cats

343
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,430
You young folks

344
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,560
are so flaky

345
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,800
Only someone like me

346
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,700
would put up with this

347
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,140
anyone else would've kicked you out

348
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,910
Hmm

349
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,480
I shouldn't have made Mr. Sheng

350
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,350
drive out of his way to pick me up

351
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,150
I took the subway back

352
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,350
See you soon

353
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,120
Your neighbor said that

354
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,320
you come back at all hours

355
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,320
and different rich Alphas drop you off

356
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,860
and pick you up

357
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,100
Listen, Hua

358
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,670
you’re young

359
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,470
don’t go down the wrong path

360
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,700
Physical attractiveness doesn't justify repeatedly enticing Alphas

361
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,510
Excuse me

362
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,310
Is the handover done?

363
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,680
Hey, what's with the attitude?

364
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,680
Noisy

365
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,320
You're ignoring me

366
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,890
while playing on your phone

367
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,930
Input the number

368
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,030
and shut your mouth

369
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,970
If you take the money

370
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,900
and can’t still keep quiet

371
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,770
I'll make sure you disappear for good

372
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,260
Well

373
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,400
It’s been late. I gotta go

374
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,700
Mr. Sheng

375
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,900
isn't this place too big?

376
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,470
Most people complain about small places

377
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:31,940
Don’t tell me you’re complaining the room’s too big

378
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,580
I think

379
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,510
the monthly rent is more than 30k

380
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,480
Don't worry about it

381
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,490
It's vacant anyway

382
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,960
Thanks, Mr. Sheng

383
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:49,730
Well

384
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,360
Stop saying that

385
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,860
I got tired of hearing that

386
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,640
Get some rest

387
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,770
I’m leaving

388
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:03,570
Good night

389
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:05,810
Umm

390
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,640
Good night, Mr. Sheng

391
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,290
What?

392
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,130
Why should I go to that banquet

393
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,400
The new JIANGHU Chamber of Commerce chairman

394
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,700
what’s that to me?

395
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,170
Fine

396
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,100
Tell the host

397
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,970
to seat me, you and Sheng Shaoyou at the same table

398
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,120
Understood

399
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,600
Hey

400
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,100
Mr. Sheng, Chairman Zhang

401
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,800
Welcome, welcome

402
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,900
You're

403
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,540
the most successful second-generation successor in JIANGHU

404
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,910
I've wanted to acquaint you for ages

405
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,440
You flatter me, Chairman Zhang

406
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,480
You're a legend in JIANGHU business circle

407
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,880
My father often

408
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,220
spoke of learning from your expertise

409
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:54,750
Nothing

410
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,390
No force could prevent my attendance at your ascension celebration

411
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,290
Thank you

412
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,120
Secretary Hua

413
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,020
didn't expect to see you here

414
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,330
Oh?

415
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,730
You know each other?

416
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,170
Mr. Sheng brought Secretary Hua

417
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,740
to a friend's party before

418
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,840
That’s why I know him

419
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,640
Wow

420
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,910
Secretary Hua has a busy social life

421
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,350
Your social calendar

422
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,950
accommodates our rivals remarkably well

423
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,420
No, Mr. Shen

424
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,420
I didn't say anything to Mr. Sheng

425
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,890
especially about our work

426
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,260
It’s because he helped me last time

427
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,020
No need to explain

428
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,990
Oops

429
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,630
My mistake

430
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,730
Allow me to toast to my oversight

431
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,370
Don't worry, Mr. Shen

432
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,300
It’s our private time

433
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,070
We met privately

434
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,170
and nothing to do

435
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,940
with your business

436
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,680
However

437
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,480
if you're still concerned

438
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,780
feel free to fire Secretary Hua

439
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,980
Our company

440
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,050
is always hiring

441
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,720
Mr. Sheng

442
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,630
You flatter me

443
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,930
ou’re already surrounded by such capable people

444
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,700
like your efficient assistant Secretary Chen

445
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,830
and a beautiful Omega companion like this young lady

446
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,640
I’m sure you don’t really need someone like Hua Yong around

447
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,400
I suppose

448
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,410
Secretary Hua would be more useful staying at HS

449
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,210
So that’s Hua Yong?

450
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,850
He looks even better in person than in photos.

451
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,280
No wonder Mr. Sheng’s always checking his Moments

452
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,380
Welcome, everyone!

453
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,420
Mr. Shen

454
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,120
thank you for having me tonight

455
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,360
Let’s have a drink

456
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,960
Apologies, Chairman Zhang

457
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,390
I’ve caught a bit of a cold

458
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,230
and just took some medicine

459
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,230
This is my secretary, Hua Yong

460
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,570
He’ll drink

461
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,200
on my behalf tonight

462
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,500
Well

463
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,840
I'm sorry President Zhang

464
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:04,710
Mr. Shen isn't feeling well today

465
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,380
Alright

466
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,990
Though as the junior

467
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:09,990
and subordinate

468
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,860
Your two drinks shall count as one of mine

469
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,230
Cheers

470
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,230
Chairman Zhang honors me beyond merit

471
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,880
I have something to take care of later

472
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,150
You can head back on your own

473
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,390
Mr. Shen

474
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,320
do you need me

475
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,560
to take you home later?

476
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:25,030
No need. You go ahead

477
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,760
I’ll take Secretary Hua home myself

478
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,370
OK

479
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,070
Guys

480
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:37,910
I have something else to attend to

481
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:39,440
so I’ll head out first

482
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,580
Let’s meet again sometime soon

483
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,860
Hi

484
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,190
Chairman Zhang

485
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,230
Secretary Chang

486
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,170
This is Sheng Shaoyou from SHENGFANG Biotech

487
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,070
and Mr. Sheng

488
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,740
this is

489
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,870
well-known Chang Yu

490
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,710
Secretary Chang

491
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,170
That is

492
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:12,710
a quite rare guest in the social circle in JIANGHU

493
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,680
Secretary Chang here

494
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,680
manages the Chairman’s office at X Holdings

495
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,120
He is the second to none

496
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,150
Eh

497
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,150
He just told me

498
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,320
he wanted to meet you

499
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,320
So of course, I brought him over immediately

500
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,730
You two

501
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,360
are in the same field

502
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,660
There’s plenty for you to talk about

503
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,600
Go on

504
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,030
Nice to meet you, Secretary Chang

505
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,700
Nice to meet you, Mr. Sheng

506
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,540
I’ve heard much about you

507
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,710
The legendary young entrepreneur of Jiang-Hu

508
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,040
Now that I’ve met you

509
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,910
you truly live up to the reputation

510
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,610
Thank you

511
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:55,050
Hello, the user you dialed is currently unable to answer

512
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,520
Mr. Sheng is here

513
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,700
Hello, Mr. Sheng

514
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,270
My phone was on mute

515
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,340
I just saw your message

516
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,340
What’s up

517
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,640
Did you get home?

518
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:52,840
Yes

519
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,640
I just got in

520
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,250
Anyway

521
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,280
What cookie flavor do you want next week?

522
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,320
Why aren’t you speaking?

523
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,190
Is it possible that

524
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,820
you anna make cookies with me at my place?

525
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:09,590
Mr. Sheng

526
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,230
Open up

527
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,440
Mr. Sheng

528
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:26,510
Gifting cookies but making me help bake them

529
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,650
just how sincere is Secretary Hua anyway?

530
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,780
I’ll always be sincere with you

531
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,820
Mr. Sheng

532
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,480
Oh really?

533
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,250
Prove it

534
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,310
Is it enough?

535
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,520
Good Morning, Mr. Sheng

536
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,490
Morning

537
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,430
Chinese breakfast

538
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,370
I hate eating Xiaolongbao,

539
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:06,100
congee and noodles first thing in the morning

540
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,210
Oh

541
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,940
I didn’t know what you liked

542
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,340
so I just prepared a little bit of everything

543
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,020
Did you sleep well last night?

544
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,130
Huh?

545
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,830
The congee and noodles, I made those myself

546
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,360
and the xiaolongbao and side dishes are takeout

547
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,000
Try it and tell me if it’s good

548
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,810
Mr. Sheng

549
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,909
Did you sleep well last night?

550
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:49,949
Umm

551
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,920
Not really well

552
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:57,190
Why

553
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,720
You tell me

554
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,860
Hangover from drinking in place of Shen Wenlang

555
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,760
I thought

556
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:04,930
No

557
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,800
It’s because of the fast heartbeat

558
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,340
Really?

559
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,740
Yes

560
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,180
It’s never beaten that fast before

561
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,690
Hmm

562
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,470
And that kept you awake?

563
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,300
What do I do from now on?

564
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,240
From now on

565
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,180
Yeah

566
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,680
What should I do

567
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:56,850
Mr. Sheng

568
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,420
if I date you

569
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,150
will I get a heart attack?

570
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,760
Why "if"?

571
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,260
Hua Yong

572
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,660
what am I to you now?

573
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,840
Taming desire like training an animal

574
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,780
feed it disliked food

575
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,310
reward it with kisses

576
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,380
Come in

577
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,490
Mr. Sheng

578
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,530
Here is a list of the suppliers we work with

579
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,330
Please take a look at it

580
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,460
The last time we were in a technical meeting

581
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,030
Sales Director of LISUI Technology

582
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,370
sprayed with our fragrance Drunk Branch

583
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,470
So I specially put the LISUI

584
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,400
removed from our list of suppliers

585
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,300
Keep them

586
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,870
We've used their purification equipment

587
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:57,910
for years

588
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,780
Don't change for any trivial reasons

589
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,380
Understood

590
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,380
And

591
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,510
HR just submitted the final inquiry

592
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,850
Last week, Chen Ke from Lab Group A left his post

593
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,150
without following protocol

594
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,920
Should we proceed with dismissal?

595
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,530
Deduct this month’s performance penalty

596
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,560
And stay on for observation

597
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,760
Yes, sir

598
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,170
Mr. Sheng seems to be in an unusually good mood lately

599
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,500
Mr. Sheng

600
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,870
Mr. Sheng, you've been working since you got here

601
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:06,140
even during dinner

602
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,050
Now why don't you eat some fruit?

603
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,320
Take a break

604
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,180
and rest your eyes

605
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,460
Mr. Shen

606
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:34,900
now

607
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,970
Okay

608
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,210
Mr. Sheng

609
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,080
Mr. Shen just asked me to bring a file over to him at the office

610
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:51,280
I’ll be right back

611
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,920
What time is it?

612
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,720
What kind of proper Omega goes running off

613
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,790
to deliver documents to another Alpha this late at night?

614
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:11,670
Hua Yong

615
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,070
let me give you a piece of advice

616
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,070
After midnight every night

617
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,040
you’re not allowed to take care of any other Alpha

618
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,640
Except me

619
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,880
Every time you come home from work

620
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,820
you smell like Shen Wenlang

621
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,720
But when you’re with me, I can’t even touch you

622
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,520
Mr. Sheng

623
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,390
I’m the Secretary of him

624
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,260
It’s only natural that

625
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,160
I pick up his scent from time to time

626
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:44,830
If you mind it

627
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,800
I’ll shower as soon as I get home

628
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,440
But don’t make it sound like I’mÿ

629
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:53,210
I never said there was anything between you and him

630
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,380
Then why won’t you ever let me touch you?

631
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,920
I have pheromone dysregulation

632
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,490
And I’m still undergoing treatments

633
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,120
The doctor said physical intimacy is prohibited

634
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:08,920
Unless

635
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,790
Unless what?

636
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,560
Nothing

637
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:17,400
Hua Yong

638
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,070
It’s not nothing

639
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,600
I want you to tell the truth

640
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,810
Unless

641
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,940
you’re willing to permanently mark me

642
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,980
I can only have sex with an Alpha who’s willing to give me a permanent mark

643
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:46,230
Permanent marking means exclusive partnership

644
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,500
I know that’s impossible

645
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,850
Mr. Sheng

646
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,880
I’m not greedy

647
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:11,250
Just being like this is already more than I ever hoped for

648
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,450
For real

649
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,060
Fine

650
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:19,230
If you don’t want to have sex , then I won’t

651
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,360
Don’t overthink it.

652
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:56,470
Mr. Sheng, there’s a company dinner tonight.

653
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:58,430
I’ll be back a bit late

654
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,150
Been leaving early and coming home late all week

655
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:12,080
what the heck are you even doing?

656
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:19,560
When will you come back?

657
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,510
Shaoyou

658
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:16,480
Come to TIANDIHUI and have a few drinks with us

659
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,150
We haven’t seen you in a whole month

660
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:21,720
I’m starting to forget what you look like

661
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,690
Busy

662
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:25,990
Don’t reject us that fast

663
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:27,190
What’s going on with you?

664
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,530
What kind of spell did that orchid-scented Omega cast on you

665
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:32,430
You’re practically abstinent for him

666
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:34,900
Come on. don’t be that friend who vanishes when they see a pretty face

667
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:38,270
Got it

668
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,750
Wow, handsome guy

669
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:50,980
Bet he’s an S-class Alpha

670
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,850
Be more confident, no need to ¡°bet¡±

671
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:54,250
He is S-class

672
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,830
Hey Shaoyou

673
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:04,930
Feels like the last time I saw Shaoyou

674
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:06,760
was in another lifetime

675
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,300
It's been a long time indeed.

676
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:13,400
Why do you look a little upset today?

677
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,310
Why would I be upset?

678
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:17,710
ShaoYou

679
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:19,270
You didn't

680
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:21,380
have a fight with that orchid-scented Omega, did you?

681
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:25,710
Why would we fight?

682
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:27,720
Good

683
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,820
Come on, the three of us haven't seen each other in a while

684
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:30,890
Let's drink till we drop

685
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,220
Drink up

686
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:34,120
C’mon, c’mon

687
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,090
One for all

688
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:37,660
Here we go

689
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:39,190
Bottoms up!

690
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:50,340
Bring a bottle of Royal Salute

691
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,070
Call over a few more Omega pals who can hold their liquor

692
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:53,610
Let’s liven things up

693
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:54,740
Yes, Mr. Zheng

694
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:34,550
Secretary Hua, take care of Mr. Sheng

695
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,690
I will

696
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:38,220
I’ll take my leave

697
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:27,100
Where did you go?

698
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,040
How was your company dinner?

699
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,240
Went to a noisy Korean BBQ place

700
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:33,310
Super noisy

701
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:35,510
and not fun at all

702
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:43,420
What about you?

703
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:46,490
Where did you go?

704
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,760
Came back so late

705
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:51,060
What's it got to do with you where I go?

706
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,330
None of your business

707
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,840
None of my business?

708
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:25,590
Such a strong Omega scent

709
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,700
I can smell it even through the door

710
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,610
Mr. Sheng

711
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,640
Did you let an Omega mark you?
