[Episode 4]

20
00:01:59,025 --> 00:02:01,727
Such a strong Omega scent.

21
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,758
I can smell it even through the door.

22
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,666
Mr. Sheng.

23
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:19,178
Did you let an Omega mark you?

24
00:02:21,547 --> 00:02:25,384
My matters are none of your concern.

25
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:38,097
You're is right.

26
00:02:38,097 --> 00:02:40,332
I'll go back to my room.

27
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:43,101
Good night.

28
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:50,909
Why are your hands so cold?

29
00:02:54,514 --> 00:02:56,114
Hua Yong.

30
00:02:56,716 --> 00:03:00,052
You've been waiting for me, haven't you?

31
00:05:09,048 --> 00:05:11,884
9:30 A.M.: Buy coffee for Mr. Shen.

32
00:05:11,884 --> 00:05:15,087
11:30 A.M.: Remind Mr. Shen to eat.

33
00:05:15,087 --> 00:05:16,822
1:30 P.M.: Remind Mr. Shen to rest.

34
00:05:16,822 --> 00:05:20,058
3:30 P.M.: Remind Mr. Shen
of the department meeting.

35
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,896
Shen Wen Lang isn't brainless.

36
00:05:22,896 --> 00:05:24,597
Why does he need someone to remind him to eat?

37
00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:26,631
That's insane.

38
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:29,602
That little brat.

39
00:05:29,602 --> 00:05:31,637
He even cares
whether Shen Wen Lang rests in the company,

40
00:05:31,637 --> 00:05:32,939
but he comes home
and gives me the silent treatment.

41
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:35,341
Not even a word to me.

42
00:05:35,341 --> 00:05:37,877
Fine, if he's ignoring me,

43
00:05:37,877 --> 00:05:41,113
why do I even bother coming back here?

44
00:05:48,487 --> 00:05:51,924
Mr. Sheng, thank you
for your hospitality these days.

45
00:05:51,924 --> 00:05:53,359
I've thought about it.

46
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:55,896
I realize that's really inconsiderate
to bother you by staying there.

47
00:05:55,896 --> 00:05:59,498
Recently, I found another place to stay at.

48
00:05:59,498 --> 00:06:01,067
I will move out tonight.

49
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:02,802
Dinner is in the fridge.

50
00:06:02,802 --> 00:06:04,770
Don't forget to eat.

51
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,574
Also, I'll repay the money you lent me on time.

52
00:06:08,574 --> 00:06:10,776
Unless necessary,

53
00:06:10,776 --> 00:06:13,045
let's never see each other again.

54
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:16,014
What does he mean by that?

55
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:30,228
Where are you going?

56
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:34,753
Mr. Sheng.

57
00:06:36,702 --> 00:06:38,804
You're back just in time.

58
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:42,742
I wanted to thank you in person for everything.

59
00:06:42,742 --> 00:06:45,644
Thank you for all your kindness.

60
00:06:46,345 --> 00:06:47,946
Goodbye.

61
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:51,617
You think you can come and go as you please?

62
00:06:51,617 --> 00:06:53,420
What do you take this place for?

63
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,587
A shelter?

64
00:06:58,224 --> 00:07:00,026
Sorry.

65
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:02,061
So, what do you want?

66
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:04,697
What do I want?

67
00:07:04,697 --> 00:07:07,232
Do I get to have what I want?

68
00:07:08,668 --> 00:07:10,268
No, I…

69
00:07:11,804 --> 00:07:15,875
If this is about meeting again, forget it.

70
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,476
Why?

71
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:24,116
Tired of our little game of kissing but no sex?

72
00:07:24,116 --> 00:07:26,152
Or...

73
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:29,721
Did you find an Alpha
willing to permanently mark you?

74
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:34,626
No.

75
00:07:53,546 --> 00:07:55,947
I just can't do this anymore.

76
00:07:56,549 --> 00:07:58,750
Why?

77
00:08:04,824 --> 00:08:07,193
Because I really like you.

78
00:08:07,193 --> 00:08:11,230
Every time I think of you with other Omegas,

79
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,865
jealousy twists me into someone awful.

80
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,068
Into someone I don't recognize.

81
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:24,643
I hate who I become.

82
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:35,388
So, let's end up this relationship.

83
00:08:35,388 --> 00:08:38,089
Let's never meet again.

84
00:08:39,557 --> 00:08:41,258
Mr. Sheng.

85
00:08:42,194 --> 00:08:44,129
I wish you happiness.

86
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:48,267
You can't leave in the middle of this.

87
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,202
I've said everything I needed to.

88
00:08:50,202 --> 00:08:52,070
But I haven't agreed.

89
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,515
Hua Yong.

90
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:04,350
Don't go.

91
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,152
Let's sit down and talk.

92
00:09:06,152 --> 00:09:07,820
Okay?

93
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,556
Say it here.

94
00:09:10,556 --> 00:09:12,658
After that, I'll leave.

95
00:09:12,658 --> 00:09:15,561
It's not that simple.

96
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:17,062
Stop fooling around.

97
00:09:17,062 --> 00:09:19,164
Put your luggage back in the room.

98
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,321
Listen to me.

99
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:55,200
Thank you.

100
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:01,941
Yong.

101
00:10:01,941 --> 00:10:03,876
Let's make up.

102
00:10:03,876 --> 00:10:07,412
No more fighting, okay?

103
00:10:10,716 --> 00:10:12,517
Okay.

104
00:10:29,869 --> 00:10:36,007
We won't quarrel anymore, right?

105
00:10:40,246 --> 00:10:41,380
Fine.

106
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,582
Mr. Shen, you have a business dinner tonight.

107
00:10:43,582 --> 00:10:45,718
Tomorrow, you're scheduled to
meet with Mr. Chu from Yuan Nan Group.

108
00:10:45,718 --> 00:10:47,152
As of now, you have
no engagements the day after.

109
00:10:47,152 --> 00:10:50,523
I'll email the materials
for Monday's weekly meeting to you shortly.

110
00:10:50,523 --> 00:10:52,123
Okay.

111
00:10:56,496 --> 00:10:57,697
Where is Gao Tu?

112
00:10:57,697 --> 00:11:00,666
Secretary Gao took ten days of leave.

113
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,302
But don't worry,
he completed the handover in advance.

114
00:11:03,302 --> 00:11:06,539
Your personal affairs
are now being handled by me.

115
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:08,408
On leave again?

116
00:11:08,408 --> 00:11:10,143
And the reason?

117
00:11:10,143 --> 00:11:11,343
Well...

118
00:11:11,343 --> 00:11:14,379
Seems like it's because of some family matters.

119
00:11:15,114 --> 00:11:16,882
What family matters?

120
00:11:16,882 --> 00:11:20,588
Probably off taking care of that Omega
who gets into a heat every other day.

121
00:11:21,856 --> 00:11:23,390
Whatever.

122
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,926
Since he loves playing
the model partner at home so much,

123
00:11:25,926 --> 00:11:28,494
he might as well not come back.

124
00:11:28,494 --> 00:11:31,463
Reassign his responsibilities to someone else.

125
00:11:31,463 --> 00:11:33,064
Understood.

126
00:12:15,074 --> 00:12:16,409
What are you standing around for?

127
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:18,443
Return the airplane.

128
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,922
Excuse me, Shen.

129
00:12:29,922 --> 00:12:32,024
Could I bother you for just one minute?

130
00:12:32,024 --> 00:12:33,027
Gao Tu.

131
00:12:33,027 --> 00:12:35,794
Excuse me, please make way.

132
00:12:35,794 --> 00:12:37,930
Shen, I only need a minute.

133
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,032
I'm not asking for anything.

134
00:12:40,032 --> 00:12:42,902
I just want to push myself, is that okay?

135
00:12:42,902 --> 00:12:45,070
Apologies.

136
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,874
You should go push someone else's boundaries.

137
00:12:47,874 --> 00:12:49,274
Shen is very busy.

138
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:50,442
So annoying.

139
00:12:50,442 --> 00:12:53,245
Even if it's a rejection,
I want to hear it from Shen himself.

140
00:12:53,245 --> 00:12:54,346
Who the hell are you?

141
00:12:54,346 --> 00:12:56,581
His watchdog?

142
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,418
- No, I'm not.
- Not what?

143
00:12:59,418 --> 00:13:02,354
You're just a Beta who sticks around
an S-Class Alpha all day.

144
00:13:02,354 --> 00:13:03,522
All you do is fend off his admirers.

145
00:13:03,522 --> 00:13:05,391
Who knows what you're really plotting?

146
00:13:05,391 --> 00:13:07,026
I doubt your intentions are pure.

147
00:13:07,026 --> 00:13:08,827
I bet you want to monopolize Shen's attention.

148
00:13:08,827 --> 00:13:11,131
Pathetic, shameless.

149
00:13:11,131 --> 00:13:12,297
Gao Tu.

150
00:13:12,297 --> 00:13:14,433
Why waste so much time on an Omega?

151
00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:16,835
Hurry up, let's go. You're making me sick.

152
00:13:21,807 --> 00:13:24,410
I hate Omegas the most.

153
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,011
Next week, when you come back to work,

154
00:13:26,011 --> 00:13:27,846
make sure you've cleaned yourself up properly.

155
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:31,283
Don't you have any idea
how strong that Omega scent on you is?

156
00:13:31,283 --> 00:13:34,186
Don't you dare come near me
with that filthy scent.

157
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:35,920
Disgusting.

158
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,714
Hello.

159
00:14:02,714 --> 00:14:03,849
Dad.

160
00:14:03,849 --> 00:14:06,485
Gao Tu! What took you so long
to answer the phone?

161
00:14:06,485 --> 00:14:07,720
You know, I...

162
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,322
I've come across a great
business opportunity lately.

163
00:14:10,322 --> 00:14:11,957
Big returns, very promising.

164
00:14:11,957 --> 00:14:13,525
But…

165
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:16,252
I'm just missing a tiny bit of start-up money.

166
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:22,034
How much do you need?

167
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,436
Not much, 10,000 would be enough.

168
00:14:24,436 --> 00:14:26,237
10,000?

169
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:30,442
You're gambling again, aren't you?

170
00:14:30,442 --> 00:14:32,878
Huh? Since when was 100,000 a big deal?

171
00:14:32,878 --> 00:14:35,681
You work at such a big fancy company now.

172
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:37,049
You must be making a ton.

173
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:39,418
And you can't even spare a bit
for your own father?

174
00:14:39,418 --> 00:14:40,886
After all I've done for you,

175
00:14:40,886 --> 00:14:42,287
this is how you repay me? You ungrateful brat!

176
00:14:42,287 --> 00:14:45,224
Dad I'm just a regular employee.

177
00:14:45,224 --> 00:14:47,992
What does the company's size
have to do with my paycheck?

178
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,130
And besides, Qing's still in the hospital.

179
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,731
Well, well, well.

180
00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:56,903
Oh, please. Qing's been sick
since she was born.

181
00:14:56,903 --> 00:14:58,003
Just a burden on all of us.

182
00:14:58,003 --> 00:15:00,005
Treatment after treatment,
but still no progress.

183
00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:03,942
If you ask me it's just a waste of money.

184
00:15:03,942 --> 00:15:05,310
Better to give up now than drag this on.

185
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,945
How can you say that?

186
00:15:06,945 --> 00:15:08,113
Qing is your daughter.

187
00:15:08,113 --> 00:15:12,185
Fine, fine, treat her if you want, whatever.

188
00:15:12,185 --> 00:15:13,185
But what about the money I asked for?

189
00:15:13,185 --> 00:15:15,387
When can you transfer it?

190
00:15:15,387 --> 00:15:16,522
I don't have that much.

191
00:15:16,522 --> 00:15:18,723
- At most, I can give you 2,000.
- What?

192
00:15:18,723 --> 00:15:20,159
2,000?

193
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,794
What the hell can I do with that?

194
00:15:21,794 --> 00:15:25,764
You make all this money
and can't give your old man a cent?

195
00:15:25,764 --> 00:15:29,200
People would call you a heartless bastard.

196
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,039
I swear, if you don't give me the money,

197
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:35,135
I'll show up at your company and make a scene.

198
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:38,777
Go ahead.

199
00:15:38,777 --> 00:15:39,945
Whatever.

200
00:15:39,945 --> 00:15:41,880
But once you've caused a scene
and I lose my job,

201
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,248
you won't even get the 2,000.

202
00:15:43,248 --> 00:15:45,116
You…

203
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:05,671
Secretary Gao,If possible,
you'd better come back early.

204
00:16:05,671 --> 00:16:08,440
Mr. Shen's been furious
about your recent absences.

205
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,575
He even dropped the ultimatum.

206
00:16:09,575 --> 00:16:11,743
He said you might as well not come back.

207
00:16:11,743 --> 00:16:15,580
Explain to him when you return
or he might target you.

208
00:16:26,258 --> 00:16:28,427
He doesn't need me at all.

209
00:16:28,427 --> 00:16:31,697
I'm the one who keeps
watching him from afar, unwilling to let go.

210
00:16:31,697 --> 00:16:33,899
He's like the moon,

211
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:35,867
brilliant, surrounded by countless stars.

212
00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:41,506
And me, I'm just one of those ordinary stars.

213
00:16:41,506 --> 00:16:44,243
Sir, this is our latest bestseller,

214
00:16:44,243 --> 00:16:45,944
the ABO Desire series
which includes a shower gel,

215
00:16:45,944 --> 00:16:47,412
body lotion, and shampoo.

216
00:16:47,412 --> 00:16:48,413
They all smell amazing.

217
00:16:48,413 --> 00:16:52,551
This one's sage-scented and that one's iris.

218
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:55,187
We also have orchid and rose
which are also popular.

219
00:16:55,187 --> 00:16:56,822
And sir, since you're a Beta,

220
00:16:56,822 --> 00:16:58,523
you don't have a natural pheromone scent.

221
00:16:58,523 --> 00:17:01,660
You can pick whatever suits your preference.

222
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,061
All are long-lasting fragrances.

223
00:17:03,061 --> 00:17:06,632
If you buy the whole set you'll also
get a bonus pheromone suppressant patch.

224
00:17:06,632 --> 00:17:09,234
Yes, and if you're not ready to buy just yet,

225
00:17:09,234 --> 00:17:13,939
you can find and follow our account online
by searching "Desire ABO Universe".

226
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:16,241
Our account is "Desire ABO Universe".

227
00:17:16,241 --> 00:17:17,876
We do live streams weekly.

228
00:17:17,876 --> 00:17:19,111
All products in the convenience store

229
00:17:19,111 --> 00:17:21,513
will be offered at their biggest discounts
during our live stream sales.

230
00:17:21,513 --> 00:17:22,648
Check out, please.

231
00:17:22,648 --> 00:17:23,915
I'll take everything in the cart.

232
00:17:23,915 --> 00:17:25,650
I'm just going to pick up a few other things.

233
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:35,094
Hey.

234
00:17:35,094 --> 00:17:37,195
Are you a quadruplet?

235
00:17:39,264 --> 00:17:40,932
Huh?

236
00:17:45,223 --> 00:17:46,616
Oh.

237
00:17:46,616 --> 00:17:48,217
Um...

238
00:17:49,408 --> 00:17:54,112
Library assistant in the morning,
KFC server at noon,

239
00:17:54,112 --> 00:17:56,982
fruit market loader in the afternoon,

240
00:17:56,982 --> 00:17:59,918
and convenience store cashier at night.

241
00:17:59,918 --> 00:18:01,219
Hey.

242
00:18:01,219 --> 00:18:03,755
We're from the same school, right?

243
00:18:03,755 --> 00:18:05,925
What's your summer homework?

244
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:09,193
A field survey of the service industry?

245
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:11,763
That'll be 24 yuan.

246
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:14,566
So, is working all these jobs your hobby?

247
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:16,501
No, I…

248
00:18:18,036 --> 00:18:21,038
This skincare line sounds interesting.

249
00:18:22,474 --> 00:18:24,542
Tell me about it.

250
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:29,314
This one just hit the shelves.

251
00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:32,084
It's on promotion right now.

252
00:18:32,084 --> 00:18:37,789
Buy one set,
get a free pheromone suppressant patch.

253
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:40,858
Would you like one?

254
00:18:42,227 --> 00:18:44,096
I'll take this.

255
00:18:44,096 --> 00:18:45,763
Check out these, too.

256
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,769
School starts in a few days.

257
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:52,537
Are you done with your summer homework?

258
00:18:52,537 --> 00:18:55,207
How much can you make from part-time jobs?

259
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:57,642
Studying should be your priority.

260
00:18:57,642 --> 00:18:59,611
Wen Lang, don't be like that.

261
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:00,979
He's from a low-income background.

262
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:03,248
Tuition at our private school is steep.

263
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:04,282
He relies on part-time jobs

264
00:19:04,282 --> 00:19:08,120
and your family foundation's scholarship.

265
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,721
Gao Tu, I'm sorry.

266
00:19:09,721 --> 00:19:11,523
Wen Lang didn't mean it.

267
00:19:11,523 --> 00:19:13,825
It's… okay.

268
00:19:18,563 --> 00:19:20,164
Shen Wen Lang!

269
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:24,369
You forgot a drink.

270
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:26,438
And your free suppressant patch, too.

271
00:19:26,438 --> 00:19:27,806
Keep it.

272
00:19:27,806 --> 00:19:29,340
Why?

273
00:19:32,778 --> 00:19:34,846
A return gift.

274
00:19:34,846 --> 00:19:37,749
The breakfasts on my desk every morning

275
00:19:37,749 --> 00:19:39,684
were bought by you, right?

276
00:19:39,684 --> 00:19:42,689
Wait, seriously?

277
00:19:42,689 --> 00:19:45,824
Gao Tu, why would you
buy breakfast for Wen Lang?

278
00:19:45,824 --> 00:19:47,259
He doesn't even eat breakfast.

279
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:49,761
Especially that kind of stuff
loaded with additives.

280
00:19:49,761 --> 00:19:51,430
He'd never touch it.

281
00:19:52,164 --> 00:19:53,465
Stop buying things for others.

282
00:19:53,465 --> 00:19:55,835
Spend it on your own lunch.

283
00:19:55,835 --> 00:19:57,969
You eat less than a kitten.

284
00:19:57,969 --> 00:19:59,604
Stop buying that junk for me.

285
00:19:59,604 --> 00:20:01,540
Eat more meat, would you?

286
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,742
You're so skinny. It's not a good look.

287
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,418
I should've given up a long time ago.

288
00:20:15,187 --> 00:20:18,923
This dream was never going to come true.

289
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,708
But...

290
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,212
giving up is so hard.

291
00:20:42,481 --> 00:20:47,018
I can't let go, I can't.

292
00:20:47,018 --> 00:20:50,422
So, i can only inject suppressants like crazy

293
00:20:50,422 --> 00:20:52,591
just to keep pretending I'm a Beta

294
00:20:52,591 --> 00:20:55,359
and just to preserve this fake friendship.

295
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:04,969
But...

296
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:10,474
it's a friendship built on lies.

297
00:21:13,445 --> 00:21:15,346
Ten years.

298
00:21:16,581 --> 00:21:19,317
Ten years is the limit.

299
00:21:20,485 --> 00:21:22,119
Shen Wen Lang.

300
00:21:23,421 --> 00:21:25,389
I'm sorry.

301
00:21:26,258 --> 00:21:28,659
I'm in love with you.

302
00:21:34,232 --> 00:21:37,369
From Q1 until now,
we've invested nearly four billion.

303
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:39,304
Yet, there's still no clear result.

304
00:21:39,304 --> 00:21:42,107
The pressure from the board is increasing.

305
00:21:42,107 --> 00:21:44,276
Several major shareholders with voting power

306
00:21:44,276 --> 00:21:45,677
now believe that
Sheng Fang Biotech going all-in

307
00:21:45,677 --> 00:21:47,712
on the development of a targeted drug
for pheromone gland carcinoma

308
00:21:47,712 --> 00:21:50,115
is just your abuse of power
for personal reasons.

309
00:21:50,115 --> 00:21:52,717
What did PR say?

310
00:21:52,717 --> 00:21:54,419
Things aren't positive.

311
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:57,322
Negative press
is dragging down our stock price.

312
00:21:57,322 --> 00:21:58,690
To make things worse,

313
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,859
HS Group is leaking information

314
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:03,128
that they've just been granted special approval

315
00:22:03,128 --> 00:22:06,565
and that their targeted drug
may complete Phase III trials

316
00:22:06,565 --> 00:22:08,199
and enter the market within two years.

317
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:10,035
Though, that might just be a move

318
00:22:10,035 --> 00:22:11,236
to inflate their stock value.

319
00:22:11,236 --> 00:22:12,837
It could all be fabricated positive news

320
00:22:12,837 --> 00:22:15,006
Mr. Sheng, you don't have to worry too much.

321
00:22:15,006 --> 00:22:17,308
How can I not worry?

322
00:22:20,378 --> 00:22:23,682
We've burned through billions
with nothing to show for it.

323
00:22:23,682 --> 00:22:26,952
And to give the lab more autonomy,

324
00:22:26,952 --> 00:22:29,554
I pushed for the technical center restructuring

325
00:22:29,554 --> 00:22:32,457
which cut into the board's turf.

326
00:22:32,457 --> 00:22:33,792
If things keep going like this,

327
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:36,161
opposition from within will only grow bigger.

328
00:22:36,161 --> 00:22:38,229
Sheng Fang will end up isolated on all sides.

329
00:22:38,229 --> 00:22:40,832
The lead scientists have made a formal pledge.

330
00:22:40,832 --> 00:22:43,101
Everyone's working overtime to speed things up.

331
00:22:43,101 --> 00:22:47,037
We've also been actively recruiting
top experts in the field.

332
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:50,208
Good

333
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:53,478
Mr. Sheng, there's something else.

334
00:22:53,478 --> 00:22:54,546
What is it?

335
00:22:54,546 --> 00:22:57,413
We've confirmed that
a high-level rep from X Holdings

336
00:22:57,413 --> 00:22:58,817
will be visiting soon.

337
00:22:58,817 --> 00:23:01,019
They're likely looking for a new partner.

338
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:02,387
Are you sure?

339
00:23:02,387 --> 00:23:04,756
Yes.

340
00:23:04,756 --> 00:23:06,591
They've already sent invitations

341
00:23:06,591 --> 00:23:10,262
to the top biopharma companies in this region.

342
00:23:10,262 --> 00:23:14,366
And I heard that person will be in town

343
00:23:14,366 --> 00:23:16,835
to personally meet with whoever's chosen.

344
00:23:16,835 --> 00:23:19,504
That's great.

345
00:23:19,504 --> 00:23:22,440
If we can connect with X Holdings

346
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,209
and get access to their patent tech,

347
00:23:26,544 --> 00:23:29,080
we won't be stuck in this corner anymore.

348
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:34,351
I don't believe Sheng Fang
can't land what HS did.

349
00:23:35,553 --> 00:23:37,689
The one thing is...

350
00:23:37,689 --> 00:23:38,923
What is it?

351
00:23:38,923 --> 00:23:41,625
Sheng Fang isn't on the invite list.

352
00:23:42,394 --> 00:23:44,929
- Why not?
- PR is still trying to figure out why.

353
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:48,433
It's odd some companies that got invited

354
00:23:48,433 --> 00:23:51,035
are nowhere near our level.

355
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,709
Find out why and report back to me.

356
00:23:57,709 --> 00:24:00,144
Yes, Mr. Sheng.

357
00:24:00,945 --> 00:24:02,514
Chen Pin Ming.

358
00:24:02,514 --> 00:24:04,716
Who's leading
the X Holdings delegation this time?

359
00:24:04,716 --> 00:24:06,117
It's Chang Yu.

360
00:24:06,117 --> 00:24:07,452
Okay.

361
00:24:07,452 --> 00:24:08,620
Got it.

362
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,888
- You can go.
- Okay.

363
00:24:13,425 --> 00:24:15,527
- Mr. Sheng.
- Yes?

364
00:24:15,527 --> 00:24:17,595
Your rut period is coming up, isn't it?

365
00:24:17,595 --> 00:24:19,698
- Yeah.
- You look tired.

366
00:24:19,698 --> 00:24:20,965
Take care of yourself.

367
00:24:20,965 --> 00:24:23,401
Your health matters more than anything.

368
00:24:23,401 --> 00:24:26,837
Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.

369
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,911
Why were we the only ones left off that list?

370
00:24:32,911 --> 00:24:37,949
I even spoke to Chang Yu
at Zhang's dinner party last time.

371
00:24:37,949 --> 00:24:40,819
We didn't have any conflict.

372
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:43,153
Why would they shut us out?

373
00:24:51,362 --> 00:24:55,166
Mr. Sheng, I'm the technical director
of Huanyu Biotech.

374
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,401
Hello.

375
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:02,107
Hey, why aren't you going to say hi
to Mr. Sheng from Sheng Fang Biotech?

376
00:25:02,107 --> 00:25:06,244
Look closely, check out the back of his neck.

377
00:25:06,244 --> 00:25:08,179
Is that a suppressant patch?

378
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:11,683
Yeah, looks like he's entering his rut.

379
00:25:11,683 --> 00:25:13,118
He is an S-class Alpha.

380
00:25:13,118 --> 00:25:14,552
I'm just a B-class.

381
00:25:14,552 --> 00:25:17,155
Better stay away during his rut period.

382
00:25:17,155 --> 00:25:19,190
One wrong move under
that kind of pheromone pressure,

383
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,358
and it's game over.

384
00:25:29,033 --> 00:25:30,634
Mr. Sheng.

385
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:32,771
- Has Chang Yu arrived?
- He has.

386
00:25:32,771 --> 00:25:34,506
But he didn't come through the main entrance.

387
00:25:34,506 --> 00:25:37,442
He went straight into the V.I.P lounge
through the side door.

388
00:25:37,442 --> 00:25:39,677
There are guards posted outside.

389
00:25:39,677 --> 00:25:42,380
A few people who know him
tried to say hi and all got turned away.

390
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,283
Better not force it.

391
00:25:45,283 --> 00:25:46,484
Yes.

392
00:25:46,484 --> 00:25:48,720
We'll try to offer him a drink privately later.

393
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,888
Got it.

394
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,892
Mr. Sheng, are you all right?

395
00:25:53,892 --> 00:25:55,526
I'm fine.

396
00:25:56,628 --> 00:25:57,862
Just...

397
00:25:57,862 --> 00:26:00,665
This rut feels different somehow.

398
00:26:00,665 --> 00:26:02,233
It's harder to control.

399
00:26:02,233 --> 00:26:03,835
You're sweating a lot.

400
00:26:03,835 --> 00:26:05,703
The suppressant patch is soaked through.

401
00:26:05,703 --> 00:26:06,805
I brought a spare.

402
00:26:06,805 --> 00:26:08,206
Would you like to step into the restroom
to apply a new patch?

403
00:26:08,206 --> 00:26:09,807
Got it.

404
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:35,634
[ABO Toilet]

405
00:26:40,939 --> 00:26:43,340
Sorry, Secretary Chang.

406
00:26:45,677 --> 00:26:46,978
Mr. Sheng is inside?

407
00:26:46,978 --> 00:26:49,180
Wow, what a grand setup.

408
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:55,787
Even going to the restroom
requires clearing out the space?

409
00:26:55,787 --> 00:27:02,126
I've really seen
the arrogance of Sheng Fang Biotech now.

410
00:27:30,355 --> 00:27:33,424
Mr. Sheng, you don't look well.

411
00:27:33,424 --> 00:27:36,728
Orchid... Smells so nice...

412
00:27:36,728 --> 00:27:39,397
Mr. Sheng, are you feeling okay?

413
00:27:39,397 --> 00:27:42,033
Come lie down for a bit

414
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:43,701
I feel awful.

415
00:27:43,701 --> 00:27:45,303
I know.

416
00:27:45,303 --> 00:27:48,339
Let me help you to the bed.

417
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:50,174
Okay.

418
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,778
Thank you, Secretary Chen.

419
00:27:53,778 --> 00:27:54,979
I'll take care of Mr. Sheng from here.

420
00:27:54,979 --> 00:27:55,980
You can go.

421
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,082
I'll take good care of him.

422
00:28:11,162 --> 00:28:13,898
I feel horrible.

423
00:28:13,898 --> 00:28:15,835
Mr. Sheng, let go.

424
00:28:15,835 --> 00:28:18,402
How am I supposed to help you change like this?

425
00:28:20,605 --> 00:28:22,206
No.

426
00:28:22,807 --> 00:28:24,876
I won't change my clothes.

427
00:28:24,876 --> 00:28:27,177
I want to sleep like this with you.

428
00:28:28,646 --> 00:28:29,714
You can't sleep in these clothes.

429
00:28:29,714 --> 00:28:31,715
You might feel uncomfortable.

430
00:28:33,084 --> 00:28:34,985
I'm not tired.

431
00:28:35,587 --> 00:28:39,357
Yong, I feel so awful.

432
00:28:39,357 --> 00:28:41,359
This feels like hell.

433
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:43,661
Don't you care at all?

434
00:28:43,661 --> 00:28:46,864
Of course I care.

435
00:28:46,864 --> 00:28:50,000
Lie down first, Mr. Sheng.

436
00:29:06,818 --> 00:29:09,487
Do you like the way
my soothing pheromones smell?

437
00:29:09,487 --> 00:29:13,524
I hope you sleep well tonight, Mr. Sheng.

438
00:29:19,697 --> 00:29:21,298
Good night.

439
00:29:26,604 --> 00:29:29,507
Mr. Sheng there are rumors

440
00:29:29,507 --> 00:29:32,510
that HS Group suddenly formed
an anti-corruption task force

441
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:35,179
targeting the core
of the pheromone-targeted drug research team.

442
00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:37,915
Mass probes has sparked public anxiety.

443
00:29:37,915 --> 00:29:40,818
Should we take advantage of this situation?

444
00:29:40,818 --> 00:29:42,553
Since ancient times,
trouble always starts from within.

445
00:29:42,553 --> 00:29:44,322
If Shen Wen Lang is stirring this up now,

446
00:29:44,322 --> 00:29:46,557
he's digging his own grave.

447
00:29:46,557 --> 00:29:48,860
Have HR set up a dedicated headhunting team.

448
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,728
While their internal morale is shaky,

449
00:29:50,728 --> 00:29:53,765
we should poach as many key people as we can.

450
00:29:53,765 --> 00:29:55,199
Got it.

451
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:56,300
But...

452
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,669
HS's confidentiality measures are airtight.

453
00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:00,671
We've only identified that
the investigation targets

454
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:02,340
are mostly in the research group.

455
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,808
The list?

456
00:30:03,808 --> 00:30:06,778
Still working on it.

457
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:09,147
But it's difficult.

458
00:30:09,147 --> 00:30:10,448
Chen Pin Ming.

459
00:30:10,448 --> 00:30:11,982
Yes?

460
00:30:12,651 --> 00:30:15,020
I'm not asking if it's difficult.
I'm asking for results.

461
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,221
You have full authority of this matter.

462
00:30:17,221 --> 00:30:19,892
I want the names of their core personnel
within a month.

463
00:30:19,892 --> 00:30:22,593
Do whatever it takes.

464
00:30:23,828 --> 00:30:25,863
Understood, Mr. Sheng.

465
00:30:43,347 --> 00:30:45,850
- Hello?
- Shao You.

466
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,618
Shao You, your rutting period is coming, right?

467
00:30:47,618 --> 00:30:50,388
Why don't we go on vacation again this time?

468
00:30:50,388 --> 00:30:53,725
Haven't I told you that
we shouldn't contact each other anymore?

469
00:30:53,725 --> 00:30:56,928
Shao You, I know you hate it
when I go out a lot.

470
00:30:56,928 --> 00:30:58,396
But I've changed.

471
00:30:58,396 --> 00:31:00,231
That's none of my business.

472
00:31:00,231 --> 00:31:01,866
Don't be like that

473
00:31:01,866 --> 00:31:05,136
I know you're with that orchid-scented Omega.

474
00:31:05,136 --> 00:31:07,405
Bo Qiao told me.

475
00:31:07,405 --> 00:31:10,208
Platonic love is romantic.

476
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:14,579
But Shao You, as an S-class Alpha,

477
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:18,249
you don't have to endure your rut alone.

478
00:31:18,249 --> 00:31:22,520
How I spend my rut is no one else's concern.

479
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,756
It was just a fling between us.

480
00:31:24,756 --> 00:31:27,925
If you want me to pay for more bags,

481
00:31:27,925 --> 00:31:29,427
just call my secretary.

482
00:31:29,427 --> 00:31:32,829
Don't call me again unless necessary.

483
00:31:49,947 --> 00:31:51,749
What is it now?

484
00:31:51,749 --> 00:31:53,918
Shao You, it's Bo Qiao.

485
00:31:53,918 --> 00:31:55,353
Why so pissy?

486
00:31:55,353 --> 00:31:56,721
Who pissed you off?

487
00:31:56,721 --> 00:32:00,191
Keep my private life to yourself,
and I might calm down.

488
00:32:00,191 --> 00:32:01,959
No way.

489
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:07,865
You know me,
can't keep a secret to save my life.

490
00:32:07,865 --> 00:32:11,035
Oh, your rut's coming

491
00:32:11,035 --> 00:32:13,070
I'm heading to Country P for a few days.

492
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,138
Wanna join?

493
00:32:14,138 --> 00:32:16,407
Country P's entertainment scene is lit.

494
00:32:16,407 --> 00:32:17,909
Tons of hot Omegas.

495
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:19,010
Count me out.

496
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,311
Why not?

497
00:32:20,311 --> 00:32:22,146
Come on, it'll be fun.

498
00:32:22,146 --> 00:32:23,347
Yu Shan's going, too.

499
00:32:23,347 --> 00:32:25,550
Bo Qiao, stop pressuring him.

500
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,584
You know Shao You.

501
00:32:26,584 --> 00:32:28,686
He never goes to Country P unless he has to.

502
00:32:29,327 --> 00:32:30,488
Do it for my sake.

503
00:32:30,488 --> 00:32:31,622
Join us.

504
00:32:31,622 --> 00:32:33,223
No.

505
00:32:33,991 --> 00:32:35,459
See?

506
00:32:35,459 --> 00:32:37,427
Told you that he'd say no.

507
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,899
I know he hates Country P,

508
00:32:41,899 --> 00:32:44,468
but I'm trying to help him get over it.

509
00:32:46,204 --> 00:32:49,584
It's all because he lost
his family pocket watch there as a kid.

510
00:32:49,584 --> 00:32:51,642
He's held a grudge ever since.

511
00:32:51,642 --> 00:32:55,979
Once he carries a grudge, his heart
is smaller than a pore on your face.

512
00:33:24,408 --> 00:33:27,177
Hua Yong, what are you doing here?

513
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,982
Why make that face?

514
00:33:30,982 --> 00:33:33,284
Shut up!

515
00:33:33,284 --> 00:33:35,752
Who said that?

516
00:33:42,026 --> 00:33:43,227
You're interrupting my nap.

517
00:33:43,227 --> 00:33:44,362
How dare you ask who I am?

518
00:33:44,362 --> 00:33:46,997
Sh-Sheng Shao You?

519
00:33:47,865 --> 00:33:50,967
An Alpha is bullying an Omega?

520
00:34:03,381 --> 00:34:04,981
Come here.

521
00:34:09,987 --> 00:34:11,788
Close your eyes.

522
00:34:12,523 --> 00:34:15,126
Just a paper tiger. It's been scared off by me.

523
00:34:15,126 --> 00:34:19,597
Don't be afraid,
I'll release some calming pheromones.

524
00:34:19,597 --> 00:34:21,698
You'll feel better.

525
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,969
Just relax.

526
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:27,404
You'll feel better soon.

527
00:34:34,278 --> 00:34:36,247
No pheromone scent.

528
00:34:36,247 --> 00:34:38,849
You're not an Omega, you're a Beta.

529
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:42,720
- Huh?
- I've never met such a cute Beta.

530
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,122
Guess calming pheromones
don't work on you, then.

531
00:34:45,122 --> 00:34:46,857
No, I'm not a Beta.

532
00:34:46,857 --> 00:34:48,559
I just haven't presented yet.

533
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:51,729
I guess that's why I can't smell your scent.

534
00:34:51,729 --> 00:34:53,664
But I'm about to present.

535
00:34:53,664 --> 00:34:55,832
What scent do you like?

536
00:34:58,002 --> 00:34:59,603
I should go.

537
00:35:01,706 --> 00:35:03,474
Sheng Shao You.

538
00:35:03,474 --> 00:35:05,710
What?

539
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,578
I need to grab something. Be right back.

540
00:35:07,578 --> 00:35:09,179
Oh.

541
00:35:20,558 --> 00:35:24,362
Can I have your contact info?

542
00:35:24,362 --> 00:35:27,030
To thank me?

543
00:35:34,472 --> 00:35:35,606
Don't bother.

544
00:35:35,606 --> 00:35:39,210
If you meet bullies again,
don't just stand there.

545
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,511
If you can't fight, run.

546
00:35:40,511 --> 00:35:43,047
At least protect yourself.

547
00:35:43,047 --> 00:35:45,916
I'll get going. Bye.

548
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:38,369
Secretary Chen, would you like tea or coffee?

549
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:41,305
Either is fine. Whatever's convenient for you.

550
00:36:41,305 --> 00:36:45,042
Sorry for dropping by without letting you know.

551
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:46,111
No worries.

552
00:36:46,111 --> 00:36:47,977
I'll make you some Kumquat tea.

553
00:36:47,977 --> 00:36:49,546
Sounds good.

554
00:37:05,129 --> 00:37:06,730
Thank you.

555
00:37:08,566 --> 00:37:10,135
Mr. Sheng is away on a business trip.

556
00:37:10,135 --> 00:37:11,635
He was worried you'd get bored alone,

557
00:37:11,635 --> 00:37:13,337
so he asked me to bring you a book.

558
00:37:13,337 --> 00:37:15,005
What book?

559
00:37:18,642 --> 00:37:21,044
Oh, this one.

560
00:37:21,912 --> 00:37:24,849
I mentioned it to Mr. Sheng a while ago.

561
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:27,118
I loved it since I was a kid.

562
00:37:27,118 --> 00:37:29,219
And I'd always wanted
to read it a few more times.

563
00:37:30,087 --> 00:37:31,922
I've been working with Mr. Sheng
for a long time.

564
00:37:31,922 --> 00:37:34,958
It's clear he cares a lot about you.

565
00:37:37,728 --> 00:37:39,863
He is very kind.

566
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:43,467
Secretary Chen.

567
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:45,068
Yeah?

568
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:51,007
Did Mr. Sheng go on a business trip
because of his rut?

569
00:37:52,276 --> 00:37:54,345
That's part of his private schedule.

570
00:37:54,345 --> 00:37:56,112
I'm not really sure.

571
00:37:58,749 --> 00:38:01,217
Private schedule.

572
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:04,621
I understand.

573
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,927
Oh, I also baked some cookies.

574
00:38:08,927 --> 00:38:11,027
Would you like to try some?

575
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:15,266
Of course. Thank you.

576
00:38:15,266 --> 00:38:16,901
Don't be shy. I made two flavors.

577
00:38:16,901 --> 00:38:18,668
Try both.

578
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,961
Secretary Chen.

579
00:38:48,399 --> 00:38:51,001
You seem to really like
our company-issued briefcase.

580
00:38:51,001 --> 00:38:53,504
If you want one, I can give you one.

581
00:38:53,504 --> 00:38:56,073
Oh, is this yours?

582
00:38:56,073 --> 00:38:57,508
I thought it was Mr. Sheng's.

583
00:38:57,508 --> 00:38:59,610
I was going to restock his business cards.

584
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,045
Last time at a business banquet,

585
00:39:01,045 --> 00:39:05,182
his cardholder was empty and he was furious.

586
00:39:05,182 --> 00:39:07,351
Mr. Sheng does have
a bit of a temper sometimes.

587
00:39:07,351 --> 00:39:09,520
Thank you for taking care of him.

588
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,989
Not at all, it's my job.

589
00:39:11,989 --> 00:39:13,090
Go on, try the cookies.

590
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,824
Freshly baked.

591
00:39:15,626 --> 00:39:17,795
I just remembered.

592
00:39:17,795 --> 00:39:20,664
Mr. Sheng asked me
to stop by the lab again today.

593
00:39:20,664 --> 00:39:22,232
I should get going.

594
00:39:22,232 --> 00:39:25,069
Of course. Work comes first.

595
00:39:25,069 --> 00:39:26,637
I'll pack the cookies up for you.

596
00:39:26,637 --> 00:39:29,172
Thank you.

597
00:39:39,817 --> 00:39:41,418
Come in.

598
00:39:52,896 --> 00:39:55,532
Mr. Shen, here's your white tea.

599
00:39:58,836 --> 00:40:00,139
What's going on with you?

600
00:40:00,139 --> 00:40:02,241
You look awful

601
00:40:02,241 --> 00:40:03,307
I'm fine.

602
00:40:03,307 --> 00:40:04,808
Don't give me that.

603
00:40:04,808 --> 00:40:06,644
Have you even looked in a mirror?

604
00:40:06,644 --> 00:40:08,945
You call that fine?

605
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:13,251
Sorry, I haven't been sleeping well lately.

606
00:40:13,251 --> 00:40:14,818
I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

607
00:40:14,818 --> 00:40:16,520
Dizzy?

608
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,721
Gao Tu.

609
00:40:17,721 --> 00:40:19,356
You're not a kid.

610
00:40:19,356 --> 00:40:21,659
If you're unwell, go see a doctor.

611
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:23,961
Don't you know how to do that?

612
00:40:23,961 --> 00:40:25,295
Gao Tu.

613
00:40:25,295 --> 00:40:27,098
What the hell are you doing?

614
00:40:27,098 --> 00:40:28,968
I've seen one.

615
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,635
It's asthma.

616
00:40:30,635 --> 00:40:32,603
Got some injections, too.

617
00:40:32,603 --> 00:40:34,471
I'm better now.

618
00:40:34,471 --> 00:40:36,072
Fine.

619
00:40:40,778 --> 00:40:42,546
Mr. Shen.

620
00:40:42,546 --> 00:40:45,915
Here's next month's procurement budget summary.

621
00:40:55,492 --> 00:40:57,094
- Gao Tu.
- Yes?

622
00:40:57,094 --> 00:40:59,629
This is the report you prepared?

623
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:05,202
You added an extra zero in the total column.

624
00:41:05,202 --> 00:41:06,403
Gao Tu.

625
00:41:06,403 --> 00:41:08,471
Are you blind?

626
00:41:10,641 --> 00:41:13,811
Sorry, I didn't check it properly.

627
00:41:13,811 --> 00:41:15,245
Checking it?

628
00:41:15,245 --> 00:41:19,350
I think your brain's off somewhere else.

629
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:22,653
Let me guess, off fantasizing
about that Omega who's constantly in heat.

630
00:41:22,653 --> 00:41:24,621
How could you even get the numbers wrong?

631
00:41:24,621 --> 00:41:28,191
Even a primary schooler
wouldn't make a mistake like this.

632
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:32,963
Mr. Shen, the report was drafted jointly
by the finance and procurement teams.

633
00:41:32,963 --> 00:41:35,365
I was only in charge of delivering it.

634
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,370
I wasn't around earlier this week,

635
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,206
so I couldn't review it myself.

636
00:41:41,206 --> 00:41:43,608
HS Group doesn't keep freeloaders.

637
00:41:43,608 --> 00:41:46,042
And I don't have time for your excuses.

638
00:41:47,277 --> 00:41:50,013
Understood. I'll correct it immediately.

639
00:41:50,681 --> 00:41:52,516
Also...

640
00:41:52,516 --> 00:41:56,085
You know how much I hate Omegas.

641
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,188
Yes, I know.

642
00:41:58,188 --> 00:42:01,825
How dare you walk into my office
reeking of some Omega's stench!

643
00:42:01,825 --> 00:42:03,794
I...

644
00:42:03,794 --> 00:42:05,763
Disgusting! Get out!

645
00:42:05,763 --> 00:42:08,064
Don't come back
until you've scrubbed yourself clean.

646
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:10,367
I'm sorry, Mr. Shen.

647
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:12,001
I'll leave now.

648
00:42:34,358 --> 00:42:37,561
No doubt he just came off someone's heat.

649
00:42:37,561 --> 00:42:39,629
Makes me want to kill someone.

650
00:42:41,031 --> 00:42:43,367
And that Secretary Chen was so clumsy.

651
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:46,036
He made such a fuss planting a bug.

652
00:42:46,036 --> 00:42:49,039
Why are all the people around me so useless?

653
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:51,542
Whatever, the timing is perfect.

654
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:53,243
Proceed with the plan.

655
00:42:53,243 --> 00:42:55,078
Lunatic.
