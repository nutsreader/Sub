00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:37,934
[Episode 7]

2
00:01:42,842 --> 00:01:44,243
I found it.

3
00:01:44,243 --> 00:01:46,234
Find it and give him the shot.

4
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:47,714
He'll feel much better after that.

5
00:01:47,714 --> 00:01:49,015
But you still need to bring him
to the hospital.

6
00:01:49,015 --> 00:01:50,550
My student's on duty tonight.

7
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,018
I'll have him wait for you
in the emergency room.

8
00:01:52,018 --> 00:01:54,720
Given his condition,
he may need to be hospitalized.

9
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:54,713
I'm so fucking sick of Sheng Shao You.

10
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:57,884
Keep your voice down. I'm in the hospital.

11
00:02:57,884 --> 00:02:59,886
Sheng Shao You is sick?

12
00:02:59,886 --> 00:03:02,555
Why can't it be me?

13
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:04,389
You're sick?

14
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,764
What are you doing here?

15
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:16,636
If I didn't come, Chang Yu would

16
00:03:16,636 --> 00:03:19,905
and it'd be worse if Sheng Shao You saw him.

17
00:03:23,476 --> 00:03:25,812
What's wrong with you?

18
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:27,613
I'm sick.

19
00:03:28,381 --> 00:03:29,849
Can't you tell?

20
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:32,251
I'm asking about how this happened.

21
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:45,865
I increased the dosage of my pheromone modifier.

22
00:03:45,865 --> 00:03:47,767
Are you crazy?

23
00:03:47,767 --> 00:03:49,869
Yeah.

24
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:51,204
Mr. Sheng spent his rut on a island

25
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:53,973
with some other Omegas...

26
00:03:53,973 --> 00:03:55,540
For seven days.

27
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,979
So what?

28
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:00,213
Look at you.

29
00:04:00,213 --> 00:04:02,315
Your face is as pale as paper.

30
00:04:02,315 --> 00:04:04,585
Why torture yourself like this?

31
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:06,752
What are you trying to get from this?

32
00:04:06,752 --> 00:04:09,489
Are you trying to compete for attention
against other Omegas?

33
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:12,024
Are you hoping Sheng Shao You will care?

34
00:04:12,024 --> 00:04:14,160
Is that so wrong?

35
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,328
You've gone completely mad.

36
00:04:17,263 --> 00:04:19,999
Mr. Sheng is too charming.

37
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:23,169
The multitudes who adore him
would drain oceans with their devotion.

38
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:25,404
What choice do I have but to try?

39
00:04:26,038 --> 00:04:29,542
You're the reason
Sheng Shao You has been harassing me non-stop.

40
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:31,878
I thought he was a romantic,

41
00:04:31,878 --> 00:04:34,813
but he's just a cheating bastard.

42
00:04:36,682 --> 00:04:40,521
He just hit you a few times.
You didn't lose a limb.

43
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:43,091
Why's an Alpha being so petty?

44
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:44,624
You sure are gracious.

45
00:04:44,624 --> 00:04:46,827
Well, why do you care who he has sex with?

46
00:04:46,827 --> 00:04:48,527
It's different.

47
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:52,665
Mr. Hua, are you awake?

48
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:55,635
- Don't come in.
- Okay, but it's time for your checkup.

49
00:04:55,635 --> 00:04:57,970
I'll bring the doctor in ten minutes, okay?

50
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,338
Sure.

51
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:04,209
There are bodyguards outside.
How did you get in?

52
00:05:07,947 --> 00:05:10,183
You climbed the window?

53
00:05:10,183 --> 00:05:11,717
This is the fourth floor.

54
00:05:11,717 --> 00:05:15,121
Didn't expect you to care about me.

55
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:18,925
I just don't want your death
to mess up my plans.

56
00:05:18,925 --> 00:05:22,995
I never understood what Sheng Shao You had

57
00:05:22,995 --> 00:05:24,397
that made you go to such lengths,

58
00:05:24,397 --> 00:05:27,232
chasing him from Country P to Jiang Hu.

59
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:33,172
Now I fucking get it,
you're both goddamn lunatics.

60
00:05:33,172 --> 00:05:35,441
Thanks for the compliment.

61
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:40,346
But since you climbed four floors to my ward,

62
00:05:40,346 --> 00:05:43,950
you must want more than just to flatter me.

63
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,384
Have you seen the news?

64
00:05:45,384 --> 00:05:48,020
Sheng Shao You shorted HS stocks maliciously

65
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,390
and sabotaged all our bids.

66
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,327
He then reported us to CSRC
like a thief crying thief.

67
00:05:54,327 --> 00:05:56,128
So?

68
00:05:56,128 --> 00:05:59,031
So, you two are perfect for each other.

69
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:02,368
Get married tomorrow, lock yourselves up,

70
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:05,237
and stop ruining the lives of ordinary folk.

71
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:08,741
Mr. Sheng is amazing.

72
00:06:08,741 --> 00:06:10,876
Yes, so amazing.

73
00:06:10,876 --> 00:06:13,746
CSRC already sent a query letter.

74
00:06:13,746 --> 00:06:15,347
Hua Yong.

75
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:17,450
Your amazing Mr. Sheng

76
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,852
caused huge losses to our company.

77
00:06:19,852 --> 00:06:22,120
What will you do to make up for that?

78
00:06:23,923 --> 00:06:27,026
Mr. Sheng has always been amazing.

79
00:06:27,026 --> 00:06:28,861
How is that my problem?

80
00:06:28,861 --> 00:06:32,832
Besides a duck in hand won't fly away.

81
00:06:32,832 --> 00:06:35,034
Wen Lang, you just failed to hold on.

82
00:06:35,034 --> 00:06:36,435
Whose fault is that?

83
00:06:36,435 --> 00:06:38,437
Why should I pay?

84
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:40,873
Because the Alpha I chose is better than yours?

85
00:06:40,873 --> 00:06:42,541
Better my ass.

86
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:48,180
He colludes on public bids
and undercuts us at cost price.

87
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,450
If you agree,
I'll collect evidence and sue him.

88
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:55,354
No, I won't break my Alpha's heart for money.

89
00:06:55,354 --> 00:06:58,758
Tell you what, I'll cover the losses.

90
00:06:58,758 --> 00:07:01,861
But from now on, avoid Sheng when you can.

91
00:07:01,861 --> 00:07:04,563
Do you think I can avoid him?

92
00:07:04,563 --> 00:07:07,466
He's the one hunting me down.

93
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:18,631
By the way,
your bidding team needs serious work.

94
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:23,048
Learn to handle collusive bids quickly.

95
00:07:24,116 --> 00:07:28,621
Hindsight is useless and just a waste of time.

96
00:07:28,621 --> 00:07:32,325
If you want something, take it.

97
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:34,593
Anything less is just incompetence.

98
00:07:37,163 --> 00:07:38,763
You're awake.

99
00:07:39,765 --> 00:07:41,766
Yeah, just woke up.

100
00:07:44,403 --> 00:07:46,005
Mr. Sheng will be back soon.

101
00:07:46,005 --> 00:07:48,808
If you have nothing else, leave now.

102
00:07:48,808 --> 00:07:51,743
So, I have to scram as soon as he arrives?

103
00:08:04,523 --> 00:08:06,926
Shen Wen Lang, you're so useless.

104
00:08:06,926 --> 00:08:08,561
Consider this a favor.

105
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:10,596
Don't rough up Mr. Sheng again.

106
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:12,798
It took him half a month to heal last time.

107
00:08:12,798 --> 00:08:13,834
I didn't like that.

108
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:17,203
Next time, don't ask me for help
with your love life.

109
00:08:17,203 --> 00:08:19,237
I don't like that either.

110
00:08:21,207 --> 00:08:23,943
You have to help me.

111
00:08:23,943 --> 00:08:25,077
Maybe I might help you in return.

112
00:08:25,077 --> 00:08:28,047
Let go. I don't need your help.

113
00:08:28,047 --> 00:08:29,515
You don't?

114
00:08:29,515 --> 00:08:32,318
You'll probably die single on your own.

115
00:08:32,318 --> 00:08:34,085
Bullshit.

116
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:42,462
Wen Lang, I hope
you'll find someone soon, like me.

117
00:08:42,462 --> 00:08:44,129
Fuck off.

118
00:08:47,466 --> 00:08:50,236
I heard you shouldn't
go straight home after discharge.

119
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:52,171
You need to eat and rest somewhere first,

120
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:54,372
so you don't bring that sickly energy back.

121
00:08:55,207 --> 00:08:57,710
You're superstitious?

122
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,981
When I was a kid,
my mom told me that after hospital stays.

123
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:04,749
What about you? Don't believe any of it?

124
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:18,430
I don't buy superstitions,
but I believe in you.

125
00:09:19,832 --> 00:09:23,636
Yong, you weren't raised in Jiang Hu, right?

126
00:09:23,636 --> 00:09:25,004
I wasn't.

127
00:09:25,004 --> 00:09:26,906
But I used to visit often.

128
00:09:26,906 --> 00:09:29,107
For your sister's medical appointments?

129
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:32,044
To see you.

130
00:09:32,044 --> 00:09:33,712
Such a sweet talker.

131
00:09:33,712 --> 00:09:35,981
If I ask where you're from,

132
00:09:35,981 --> 00:09:38,984
will you say you're from my heart?

133
00:09:40,853 --> 00:09:43,922
Is that the case?

134
00:09:51,997 --> 00:09:53,598
Yes.

135
00:10:00,172 --> 00:10:01,573
Come in.

136
00:10:09,281 --> 00:10:10,882
Mr. Shen.

137
00:10:18,224 --> 00:10:20,793
Wen Lang, is Yong with you?

138
00:10:20,793 --> 00:10:23,329
Why isn't he answering my phone?

139
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:25,930
He isn't. No idea.

140
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,436
You're both in Jiang Hu.

141
00:10:30,436 --> 00:10:32,504
How can you not know?

142
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:35,207
So what if we're both here?

143
00:10:35,207 --> 00:10:36,809
You're his cousin,

144
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:39,945
yet you can't get through to him either.

145
00:10:39,945 --> 00:10:41,846
Fair point.

146
00:10:42,648 --> 00:10:44,683
What's the matter?

147
00:10:44,683 --> 00:10:46,986
Just finished an emergency joint meeting.

148
00:10:46,986 --> 00:10:51,124
We designed response plans
for Sheng Fang Biotech's actions against us.

149
00:10:51,124 --> 00:10:52,791
Got it.

150
00:10:53,626 --> 00:10:55,060
Well...

151
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,695
Mr. Shen.

152
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:01,767
[Shen Yu]

153
00:11:15,848 --> 00:11:20,586
Shen Wen Lang, I know your company
in Jiang Hu is in trouble.

154
00:11:20,586 --> 00:11:23,022
I know how hard Brother Yi worked to raise you.

155
00:11:23,022 --> 00:11:24,823
So, apologize and come home now.

156
00:11:24,823 --> 00:11:27,226
If you do, I might spare your legs

157
00:11:27,226 --> 00:11:30,863
and help you through this.

158
00:11:30,863 --> 00:11:34,400
Whether Dad had it easy or not, he's dead.

159
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,370
You should know best how he died, Shen Yu.

160
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,538
Just give up.

161
00:11:39,538 --> 00:11:42,173
That place stopped being my home
the day I walked out.

162
00:11:46,245 --> 00:11:48,379
What did you say just now?

163
00:11:49,515 --> 00:11:51,951
The car you asked for is ready.

164
00:11:51,951 --> 00:11:53,452
It's waiting in the parking garage.

165
00:11:53,452 --> 00:11:54,453
Where are you heading?

166
00:11:54,453 --> 00:11:56,488
Do you need any preparations?

167
00:11:57,122 --> 00:11:58,222
I'm heading out for lunch.

168
00:11:58,222 --> 00:12:00,292
Is this a last-minute business lunch?

169
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:01,794
Who else is joining?

170
00:12:01,794 --> 00:12:03,862
I can prepare in advance.

171
00:12:04,597 --> 00:12:06,798
You don't need to prepare anything.

172
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,868
Just come with me.

173
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:16,641
Oh.

174
00:12:18,844 --> 00:12:22,247
I prepared a gift for you.

175
00:12:22,247 --> 00:12:24,449
Thank you for being so nice to me.

176
00:12:25,851 --> 00:12:27,452
A watch?

177
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,758
It's just the basic model.

178
00:12:32,758 --> 00:12:35,426
I can't afford anything too luxurious yet.

179
00:12:38,163 --> 00:12:41,266
Basic models are great, versatile.

180
00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:45,270
Does it look good?

181
00:12:46,238 --> 00:12:49,008
Mr. Shen, isn't this a business lunch?

182
00:12:49,008 --> 00:12:50,042
No.

183
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:51,644
Well...

184
00:12:51,644 --> 00:12:53,344
What's today's date?

185
00:12:55,681 --> 00:12:57,149
May 19.

186
00:12:57,149 --> 00:12:59,551
You forgot your own birthday?

187
00:13:07,626 --> 00:13:10,362
Let's go. I'll take you out for a meal.

188
00:13:10,362 --> 00:13:12,030
I ordered a birthday cake.

189
00:13:43,395 --> 00:13:45,230
You're like a bad penny.

190
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,434
And you reek of Drunk Branch.

191
00:13:48,434 --> 00:13:52,739
People might think
a toilet scrubber came to life.

192
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:54,039
HS Group used my pheromone scent

193
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:56,942
to develop products without permission.

194
00:13:56,942 --> 00:13:59,478
Shen Wen Lang, you hate Omegas,

195
00:13:59,478 --> 00:14:01,914
but you keep clashing with me over Hua Yong.

196
00:14:01,914 --> 00:14:04,349
You follow me everywhere.

197
00:14:04,349 --> 00:14:08,119
Do you have a crush on me?

198
00:14:08,887 --> 00:14:11,712
Paranoia needs early treatment.

199
00:14:11,712 --> 00:14:13,192
Save your confession.

200
00:14:13,192 --> 00:14:15,693
There's a limit to being crazy.

201
00:14:17,196 --> 00:14:19,898
Sheng Shao You, I heard you never date Omegas

202
00:14:19,898 --> 00:14:22,835
who've been with Alphas.

203
00:14:22,835 --> 00:14:26,672
Hua Yong is useless to you, then.

204
00:14:26,672 --> 00:14:27,673
Why not give him to me?

205
00:14:27,673 --> 00:14:29,474
Shen Wen Lang!

206
00:14:32,478 --> 00:14:36,515
Several X Holdings executives
are interested in him.

207
00:14:36,515 --> 00:14:38,550
If you hand him over,

208
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:43,321
I might share the targeted drug technology
with Sheng Fang.

209
00:14:49,962 --> 00:14:52,164
Gao Tu, you leave first.

210
00:14:52,164 --> 00:14:55,066
Don't let toilet fumes trigger your asthma.

211
00:14:56,435 --> 00:14:58,504
Mr. Sheng, forget it.

212
00:14:58,504 --> 00:15:00,271
Let's go.

213
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,107
Just you wait.

214
00:15:07,012 --> 00:15:10,048
I'll wait for you to decide

215
00:15:10,048 --> 00:15:12,184
if you'll trade Hua Yong for the tech.

216
00:15:12,184 --> 00:15:14,485
You're better off waiting for your death.

217
00:15:40,212 --> 00:15:44,550
So, what's between you and Mr. Sheng?

218
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,485
Sheng Shao You is insane.

219
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:48,587
He picks fights for no reason.

220
00:15:48,587 --> 00:15:51,089
What about Secretary Hua?

221
00:15:53,325 --> 00:15:55,961
Birds of a feather flock together.

222
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:58,229
He's just good-looking.

223
00:15:58,864 --> 00:16:00,265
What about you?

224
00:16:00,265 --> 00:16:01,866
What about me?

225
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:05,571
If you hadn't done nothing,

226
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:09,142
why would Mr. Sheng retaliate so violently?

227
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:11,042
How should I know?

228
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:21,052
Why are you looking at me like that?

229
00:16:30,596 --> 00:16:32,196
Gao Tu.

230
00:16:33,665 --> 00:16:37,537
You don't think
I'd do something to Hua Yong, do you?

231
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:38,604
I don't know.

232
00:16:38,604 --> 00:16:39,905
What do you mean by that?

233
00:16:39,905 --> 00:16:42,173
It means I don't know.

234
00:16:57,189 --> 00:17:00,958
Gao Tu, whose side are you on, mine or Sheng's?

235
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:06,932
I get paid by the company,

236
00:17:06,932 --> 00:17:10,435
so I view things
from the company's perspective.

237
00:17:10,435 --> 00:17:12,270
That's not what I asked.

238
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:15,406
If you ignored your paycheck,
whose side are you on?

239
00:17:20,712 --> 00:17:23,582
The moral side.

240
00:17:23,582 --> 00:17:24,850
Oh.

241
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:29,388
Sheng Shao You abuses power
and picks fights in public.

242
00:17:29,388 --> 00:17:30,989
He's definitely immoral.

243
00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:32,590
And you?

244
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:36,228
You made Secretary Hua act like an escort.

245
00:17:36,228 --> 00:17:38,029
Is that moral?

246
00:17:39,364 --> 00:17:42,133
Do you know who you're talking to?

247
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,072
Sorry, Mr. Shen.

248
00:17:47,072 --> 00:17:48,973
I spoke out of turn.

249
00:17:52,077 --> 00:17:54,513
It's 1 P.M.

250
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:55,781
Shouldn't you return to the office?

251
00:17:55,781 --> 00:17:58,583
Do you think I want to stay in this dump?

252
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,351
If it weren't your special day...

253
00:18:01,887 --> 00:18:04,389
Do you think I'd want to?

254
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:05,990
Yeah.

255
00:18:07,192 --> 00:18:11,330
Yes, my small and shabby place
isn't fit for you.

256
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,532
You should leave.

257
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:15,600
First Hua Yong,

258
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,235
now Sheng Shao You.

259
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:20,439
Why do you always argue with me
over those baffling people?

260
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:22,473
Do you like them?

261
00:18:27,412 --> 00:18:30,749
Now I get why a Beta like you

262
00:18:30,749 --> 00:18:33,584
is so sensitive to Sheng Shao You's pheromones.

263
00:18:34,286 --> 00:18:36,587
You like him, don't you?

264
00:18:48,066 --> 00:18:49,701
Are you okay?

265
00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:51,469
What's wrong?

266
00:19:32,611 --> 00:19:34,645
You're burning up.

267
00:19:41,186 --> 00:19:43,221
Do you have antipyretics?

268
00:19:44,489 --> 00:19:46,090
No.

269
00:19:47,092 --> 00:19:48,427
I'm fine.

270
00:19:48,427 --> 00:19:50,428
How can you be fine?

271
00:19:51,196 --> 00:19:53,165
You forgot your birthday

272
00:19:53,165 --> 00:19:55,166
and didn't even say a word about your fever.

273
00:19:56,301 --> 00:20:00,439
Even kids know to see a doctor
when they're sick.

274
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:04,108
How old are you, really?

275
00:20:09,648 --> 00:20:11,382
I'll buy medicine.

276
00:20:17,989 --> 00:20:19,891
You don't have to, really.

277
00:20:22,627 --> 00:20:24,228
Shen Wen Lang.

278
00:20:25,764 --> 00:20:28,633
Can you stay with me a little longer?

279
00:20:36,341 --> 00:20:37,942
Okay.

280
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:08,339
Happy birthday.

281
00:21:20,585 --> 00:21:22,888
What did you promise me?

282
00:21:22,888 --> 00:21:24,623
Be reasonable!

283
00:21:24,623 --> 00:21:26,191
Sheng Shao You attacked first.

284
00:21:26,191 --> 00:21:27,292
I was defending myself.

285
00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:31,662
If you fight Mr. Sheng again,
I won't help you.

286
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:35,466
Seriously, who's helping who here?

287
00:21:40,872 --> 00:21:42,440
Feeling better?

288
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,843
Yeah, the medicine helped.

289
00:21:47,812 --> 00:21:49,981
Oh right.

290
00:21:49,981 --> 00:21:52,717
Bo Qiao just signed his first order.

291
00:21:52,717 --> 00:21:55,820
He called to invite everyone
for dinner this weekend.

292
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,156
Will you come with me?

293
00:21:58,156 --> 00:22:00,324
Okay.

294
00:22:11,103 --> 00:22:14,839
Mr. Sheng, I'm dressed. Let's go.

295
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:17,842
I told you to dress casually.

296
00:22:20,312 --> 00:22:22,446
I did.

297
00:22:32,654 --> 00:22:35,126
Casually.

298
00:22:35,126 --> 00:22:36,828
Get it?

299
00:22:36,828 --> 00:22:39,530
Who told you to look this handsome?

300
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:48,440
Fine, since you look so good today,

301
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,109
I'll tell you a secret.

302
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:52,544
What is it?

303
00:22:52,544 --> 00:22:57,716
Don't show up this handsome
at gatherings again.

304
00:22:57,716 --> 00:22:59,884
I'll get jealous.

305
00:23:03,588 --> 00:23:07,224
Then I'll just go out without washing my face.

306
00:23:07,892 --> 00:23:09,961
What about you?

307
00:23:09,961 --> 00:23:12,364
You're always attracting others.

308
00:23:12,364 --> 00:23:14,733
I get jealous, too.

309
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:18,470
Jealous? What are you going to do about that?

310
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,171
I'll do this.

311
00:23:30,782 --> 00:23:34,419
Come on, drinks on me tonight.

312
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:36,253
Come on.

313
00:23:43,895 --> 00:23:45,596
Here comes Shao You...

314
00:23:46,231 --> 00:23:48,132
And Yong.

315
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,903
Should he be "Mrs. Sheng" now?

316
00:23:56,508 --> 00:23:58,310
Shove off, he's shy.

317
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,412
Don't talk nonsense.

318
00:24:00,412 --> 00:24:02,247
Congrats on the deal.

319
00:24:02,247 --> 00:24:03,848
Thanks, Yong.

320
00:24:03,848 --> 00:24:06,383
Yu Shan is over there. Let's sit there.

321
00:24:43,634 --> 00:24:45,300
[Chen Pin Ming]

322
00:24:49,061 --> 00:24:50,328
I need to take a call.

323
00:24:50,328 --> 00:24:52,062
- Wait here.
- Okay.

324
00:24:52,931 --> 00:24:55,232
Yu Shan, Bo Qiao.

325
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:57,102
Go ahead.

326
00:24:57,102 --> 00:24:59,837
We'll look after Yong.

327
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,981
Didn't know you can hold your liquor.

328
00:25:15,787 --> 00:25:18,424
Are you bored without Shao You?

329
00:25:18,424 --> 00:25:19,557
Come on.

330
00:25:19,557 --> 00:25:21,626
Let me keep you company.

331
00:25:21,626 --> 00:25:23,327
I'm not bored.

332
00:25:25,997 --> 00:25:30,301
Yong, heard you went missing for a while.

333
00:25:37,876 --> 00:25:41,278
Shao you really freaked out when you were gone.

334
00:25:45,683 --> 00:25:47,452
Was Mr. Sheng really that anxious?

335
00:25:47,452 --> 00:25:49,154
Anxious?

336
00:25:49,154 --> 00:25:51,923
He nearly turned Jiang Hu upside down.

337
00:25:51,923 --> 00:25:56,092
Honestly I've never seen Shao You like this.

338
00:25:56,092 --> 00:25:58,329
Not for any Omega.

339
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:04,702
Mr. Sheng, intel shows board members

340
00:26:04,702 --> 00:26:10,743
are plotting a chairman re-election
to remove you from power.

341
00:26:10,743 --> 00:26:12,076
Why?

342
00:26:12,076 --> 00:26:16,047
Recently, we've snatched all HS bids,

343
00:26:16,047 --> 00:26:22,720
shorted their stocks,
and spent heavily on targeted drugs.

344
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,026
Shareholders say this has caused
irreversible impact on Sheng Fang.

345
00:26:28,026 --> 00:26:30,829
Our cash flow is healthy.

346
00:26:30,829 --> 00:26:35,366
The HS projects we won are all model cases.

347
00:26:35,366 --> 00:26:37,068
I don't think there is any issue.

348
00:26:37,068 --> 00:26:38,969
As for the targeted drugs...

349
00:26:42,106 --> 00:26:44,075
Exploring innovative drugs

350
00:26:44,075 --> 00:26:47,212
won't hurt Sheng Fang Biotech.

351
00:26:47,212 --> 00:26:48,654
What really causes harm
is resting on past achievements

352
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:51,248
and refusing to move forward.

353
00:26:51,883 --> 00:26:54,219
- Chen Pin Ming.
- Yes.

354
00:26:54,219 --> 00:26:58,546
First thing tomorrow,
organize reports on our recent winning bids

355
00:26:58,546 --> 00:27:00,725
and bring them to my office.

356
00:27:00,725 --> 00:27:03,427
I'll handle the board.

357
00:27:12,504 --> 00:27:18,308
Yong, Shao You isn't the only Alpha around.

358
00:27:23,581 --> 00:27:26,251
Why don't you add me on WeChat?

359
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:29,086
If you ever break up with him,
you can come find me.

360
00:27:34,692 --> 00:27:35,793
Break up?

361
00:27:35,793 --> 00:27:37,328
Yeah.

362
00:27:37,328 --> 00:27:40,465
If that day ever comes, I'll be right here.

363
00:27:40,465 --> 00:27:43,600
Whatever Shao You can give you, I can too.

364
00:27:45,036 --> 00:27:46,770
You can't.

365
00:27:48,473 --> 00:27:49,807
You haven't even told me what you want.

366
00:27:49,807 --> 00:27:52,443
How do you know I can't?

367
00:27:55,413 --> 00:27:58,182
Because I'm not breaking up with Mr. Sheng.

368
00:27:58,182 --> 00:28:00,184
So sure of that?

369
00:28:00,184 --> 00:28:04,154
Yeah, I only like Mr. Sheng.

370
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,293
But feelings change.

371
00:28:08,293 --> 00:28:10,962
You haven't known him that long.

372
00:28:10,962 --> 00:28:14,599
Life is long, Yong.

373
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:18,369
Today you love him,
tomorrow you might love me.

374
00:28:19,704 --> 00:28:25,243
Or maybe not tomorrow.
Maybe in three, five, ten years.

375
00:28:25,243 --> 00:28:26,644
Yong.

376
00:28:26,644 --> 00:28:30,581
Someone like you must have a lot of admirers.

377
00:28:31,382 --> 00:28:34,419
It's only a matter of time
before your heart shifts.

378
00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:36,554
You don't have to answer me now.

379
00:28:36,554 --> 00:28:41,426
If you ever change your mind,
think of me first.

380
00:28:41,426 --> 00:28:43,360
I won't change my mind.

381
00:28:44,062 --> 00:28:48,066
Didn't expect you to be quite the romantic.

382
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:50,435
Fine, let's say you won't waver.

383
00:28:50,435 --> 00:28:52,069
But what about Shao You?

384
00:28:53,171 --> 00:28:55,406
You haven't been with him that long.

385
00:28:55,406 --> 00:29:00,812
From what I know of him,
he doesn't believe in forever.

386
00:29:00,812 --> 00:29:03,448
You two haven't even hit a year, right?

387
00:29:03,448 --> 00:29:07,317
But this is already
the longest relationship he's ever had.

388
00:29:13,758 --> 00:29:16,961
Mr. Sheng, here are the proposals
for the 17 projects we secured this quarter.

389
00:29:16,961 --> 00:29:18,562
Please take a look.

390
00:29:20,465 --> 00:29:22,533
Sales performance has been solid

391
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:25,803
and the fixed asset turnover has improved.

392
00:29:30,108 --> 00:29:34,479
Since the door's closed,
no need for pleasantries.

393
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:37,582
The board's stance was clear
in this morning's meeting.

394
00:29:37,582 --> 00:29:39,451
We've had it easy for too long.

395
00:29:39,451 --> 00:29:41,352
The moment there's even a hint of risk,

396
00:29:41,352 --> 00:29:44,021
they all want answers from me.

397
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:48,292
The last mile is always the hardest.

398
00:29:48,292 --> 00:29:52,098
Drug development is full of uncertainty.

399
00:29:52,098 --> 00:29:55,226
Most people collapse just before dawn.

400
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:56,834
Mr. Sheng.

401
00:29:57,835 --> 00:30:00,772
But my father always said something very true.

402
00:30:00,772 --> 00:30:03,908
Life is just a big amusement park.

403
00:30:03,908 --> 00:30:06,310
The brave get to enjoy the ride first.

404
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:09,047
The drug project isn't without hope.

405
00:30:09,047 --> 00:30:12,250
Since we got the list
of HS's senior technical staff,

406
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,752
the recruitment team
has already met several of them.

407
00:30:14,752 --> 00:30:16,921
We should see new progress soon.

408
00:30:16,921 --> 00:30:21,893
Also, regarding your request
to track X Holdings' Chang Yu,

409
00:30:21,893 --> 00:30:26,630
I received word that he'll
be in Jiang Hu tonight for a private event.

410
00:30:27,231 --> 00:30:28,766
What kind of event?

411
00:30:28,766 --> 00:30:31,836
The Minister of Commerce
from Country P is visiting Jiang Hu.

412
00:30:31,836 --> 00:30:35,005
Tonight's a private dinner hosted by him.

413
00:30:37,842 --> 00:30:41,180
Heard that ugly guy from X Holdings

414
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,248
is pretty tight with that minister, right?

415
00:30:44,248 --> 00:30:47,552
Yes, there are rumors about that.

416
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:50,888
Rumor has it X Holdings
sponsored the whole event,

417
00:30:50,888 --> 00:30:53,524
from venue to security.

418
00:30:53,524 --> 00:30:56,126
All handled by X Holdings.

419
00:30:56,828 --> 00:31:00,231
They've been very active in Jiang Hu lately.

420
00:31:00,231 --> 00:31:03,067
After they excluded us
from the last industry summit,

421
00:31:03,067 --> 00:31:05,770
people have been talking.

422
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:10,041
There are rumors that they look down on us

423
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:12,276
and think we lack
true research and development capabilities.

424
00:31:12,276 --> 00:31:15,613
Ridiculous. Of all the companies they invited,

425
00:31:15,613 --> 00:31:18,181
none can match our R&D strength.

426
00:31:24,322 --> 00:31:26,991
Send me the time and location of the event.

427
00:31:26,991 --> 00:31:28,860
There are rumors in the second-gen circles

428
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:32,563
that ugly freak from X Holdings
has been hiding out in Jiang Hu.

429
00:31:32,563 --> 00:31:34,232
I'll try my luck.

430
00:31:34,232 --> 00:31:35,233
Okay.

431
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:36,933
The event requires every Alpha

432
00:31:36,933 --> 00:31:39,604
to bring an Omega companion.

433
00:31:39,604 --> 00:31:42,306
Should I find someone for you

434
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,843
or invite Mr. Hua?

435
00:31:45,843 --> 00:31:48,679
Events like this are always full of riffraff.

436
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:51,783
Isn't Shen Wen Liang enough for you?

437
00:31:51,783 --> 00:31:53,785
Apologies, sir.

438
00:31:53,785 --> 00:31:55,886
How about Miss Shu?

439
00:31:56,821 --> 00:31:58,289
It's just a party.

440
00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:01,425
Anyone's fine as long as it's not Hua Yong.

441
00:32:04,195 --> 00:32:05,963
A pleasure working with you both.

442
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:10,434
I truly enjoyed our talk today.

443
00:32:10,434 --> 00:32:12,136
I hope we can start working together soon.

444
00:32:12,136 --> 00:32:13,604
Sounds good.

445
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,486
Long time no see, Secretary Chang.

446
00:32:28,486 --> 00:32:29,887
Long time no see.

447
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:33,156
Sheng, you're surprisingly approachable today.

448
00:32:33,758 --> 00:32:36,827
No need to clear the room with your pheromones?

449
00:32:38,663 --> 00:32:40,864
You flatter me.

450
00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:46,803
And this is?

451
00:32:47,405 --> 00:32:49,407
Shu Xin.

452
00:32:49,407 --> 00:32:53,210
Hello, Secretary Chang. I'm Shu Xin.

453
00:32:53,844 --> 00:32:55,946
I'm Mr. Sheng's girlfriend.

454
00:32:58,382 --> 00:33:00,451
Miss Shu is very beautiful.

455
00:33:00,451 --> 00:33:02,986
Mr. Sheng, you have great taste.

456
00:33:35,486 --> 00:33:37,087
See you around.

457
00:33:41,626 --> 00:33:43,361
Secretary Chang.

458
00:33:43,361 --> 00:33:45,763
Minister Wang, I heard you were coming.

459
00:33:45,763 --> 00:33:48,232
So, Jiang Hu's elite showed up in full force.

460
00:33:48,232 --> 00:33:50,001
Quite the turnout.

461
00:33:50,001 --> 00:33:51,102
Not at all.

462
00:33:51,102 --> 00:33:53,271
All honors are but reflections
of your esteemed influence.

463
00:33:53,271 --> 00:33:54,705
It's nothing.

464
00:33:54,705 --> 00:33:56,472
And who might this be?

465
00:33:56,472 --> 00:33:58,894
Minister Wang, let me introduce him.

466
00:33:58,894 --> 00:34:00,544
This is the president of Sheng Fang Biotech,

467
00:34:00,544 --> 00:34:03,349
Mr. Sheng Shao You.

468
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:06,984
And this is Minister Wang
from Country P's Ministry of Commerce,

469
00:34:06,984 --> 00:34:09,553
one of the key figures
behind Country P's economic rise.

470
00:34:09,553 --> 00:34:12,023
Minister Wang, pleasure.
I've heard a lot about you.

471
00:34:12,023 --> 00:34:14,391
The pleasure's mine.

472
00:34:20,998 --> 00:34:23,968
I've heard Mr. Sheng
is a bold and forthright man

473
00:34:23,968 --> 00:34:27,104
Tonight, I see it for myself.

474
00:34:27,104 --> 00:34:29,673
Cheers.

475
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,589
- You hold your liquor well.
- He can drink a lot.

476
00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:47,626
Minister Wang, I'm Shu Xin.

477
00:34:47,626 --> 00:34:49,660
I've heard so much about you.
It's an honor to meet you.

478
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,729
You're truly graceful and elegant.

479
00:34:59,704 --> 00:35:04,608
Minister Wang, Mr. Sheng
is one of Jiang Hu's rising stars.

480
00:35:04,608 --> 00:35:06,711
A young and talented entrepreneur.

481
00:35:06,711 --> 00:35:10,181
And Minister Wang's been a driving force
behind Country P's boom.

482
00:35:10,181 --> 00:35:12,249
Without him, it wouldn't be where it is today.

483
00:35:12,249 --> 00:35:13,751
So, I hope the two of you

484
00:35:13,751 --> 00:35:15,052
will have many chances to work together.

485
00:35:15,052 --> 00:35:16,387
And that Sheng Fang Biotech

486
00:35:16,387 --> 00:35:18,222
can rely on Minister Wang's support

487
00:35:18,222 --> 00:35:19,623
as it expands into Country P.

488
00:35:19,623 --> 00:35:21,958
To our future cooperation.

489
00:35:35,906 --> 00:35:37,408
What do you say, Mr. Sheng?

490
00:35:37,408 --> 00:35:39,676
Bottoms up.

491
00:35:55,092 --> 00:35:57,728
Shao You, do you have a headache?

492
00:35:57,728 --> 00:35:59,596
Let me give you a massage.

493
00:36:01,665 --> 00:36:03,801
That Secretary Chang was too much.

494
00:36:03,801 --> 00:36:05,069
He kept making you drink

495
00:36:05,069 --> 00:36:07,003
and wouldn't even let me help.

496
00:36:14,645 --> 00:36:16,279
What are you doing?

497
00:36:16,914 --> 00:36:19,850
Shao You, you're drunk.

498
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:22,154
I don't feel safe letting you go home alone.

499
00:36:22,154 --> 00:36:24,722
My place is nearby.

500
00:36:24,722 --> 00:36:29,360
Why not stay the night there?

501
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,328
I can take care of you.

502
00:36:40,371 --> 00:36:42,206
Get off me.

503
00:36:42,206 --> 00:36:43,840
Stay away.

504
00:36:46,811 --> 00:36:48,813
Chen Pin Ming.

505
00:36:48,813 --> 00:36:51,649
- Yes?
- Take Miss Shu home

506
00:36:51,649 --> 00:36:53,217
Okay.

507
00:36:53,217 --> 00:36:55,553
Miss Shu, please show some respect.

508
00:36:55,553 --> 00:36:58,321
Sheng already has an Omega he cares about.

509
00:37:04,829 --> 00:37:10,400
Please sit properly and take your hand off him.

510
00:37:43,968 --> 00:37:46,470
Mr. Sheng, we've arrived.

511
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,071
Okay.

512
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:55,546
Another night wasted.

513
00:37:55,546 --> 00:37:58,616
All that, just to meet Chang Yu again.

514
00:37:58,616 --> 00:38:03,087
Is that rat from X Holdings
afraid to show his hideous face?

515
00:38:03,087 --> 00:38:05,021
Always hiding in the dark.

516
00:38:13,664 --> 00:38:15,432
Like totally a monster.

517
00:38:15,432 --> 00:38:17,867
He'll get what's coming for him.

518
00:38:23,541 --> 00:38:25,208
Mr. Sheng.

519
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,344
Did he drink too much?

520
00:38:27,344 --> 00:38:29,413
Yes, he's been going to
a lot of dinners lately.

521
00:38:29,413 --> 00:38:31,514
Sorry to trouble you with looking after him.

522
00:38:43,194 --> 00:38:45,195
No trouble at all.

523
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,425
Mr. Sheng.

524
00:39:49,026 --> 00:39:50,995
You stink.

525
00:39:50,995 --> 00:39:53,029
I stink?

526
00:40:06,076 --> 00:40:09,879
I don't like smelling someone else on you.

527
00:40:10,581 --> 00:40:12,348
I hate it.

528
00:40:15,185 --> 00:40:17,287
So, I'll wash it off.

529
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:47,611
Mr. Sheng.

530
00:41:47,611 --> 00:41:49,680
You were so drunk last night.

531
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,448
I made you hangover soup,
but you wouldn't even drink it.

532
00:41:53,317 --> 00:41:56,152
I must've kept you up late again.

533
00:41:58,088 --> 00:42:00,958
Next time I'm drinking like that,

534
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:03,126
just leave me alone.

535
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:11,200
I don't want to tire you out.

536
00:42:16,473 --> 00:42:18,074
Okay.

537
00:42:36,727 --> 00:42:38,262
Come in.

538
00:42:38,262 --> 00:42:41,732
Mr. Sheng, Secretary Chang just messaged.

539
00:42:41,732 --> 00:42:43,433
The gentleman from X Holdings

540
00:42:43,433 --> 00:42:46,103
is inviting you to his private banquet.

541
00:42:46,103 --> 00:42:48,771
Seems like last night's drinking
wasn't for nothing.

542
00:42:50,274 --> 00:42:57,147
Also, this month's monthly meeting
is set for 2 P.M. in the main conference room.

543
00:42:57,147 --> 00:42:58,982
You don't look too well, sir.

544
00:42:58,982 --> 00:43:01,485
Have you been pushing yourself too hard
with all these social engagements lately?

545
00:43:01,485 --> 00:43:03,786
Might be good to get some rest before then.

546
00:43:06,123 --> 00:43:07,357
The bio pharmaceutical industry

547
00:43:07,357 --> 00:43:10,828
is entering the next decade
of digital transformation.

548
00:43:10,828 --> 00:43:14,832
The Metaverse is reshaping how companies
interact and coexist with their customers.

549
00:43:14,832 --> 00:43:18,101
We surveyed 100 senior executives in the field.

550
00:43:18,101 --> 00:43:23,841
85% said the Metaverse
has had a positive impact on their lives.

551
00:43:23,841 --> 00:43:25,742
It is significantly higher
than the average across other industries.

552
00:43:25,742 --> 00:43:28,144
Mr. Sheng!

553
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:35,986
Chen Pin Ming, get my inhibitor patch now.

554
00:43:35,986 --> 00:43:37,353
Yes, sir.

555
00:43:50,667 --> 00:43:53,102
Mr. Sheng, let me take you to the lounge.

556
00:44:03,914 --> 00:44:05,515
Mr. Sheng.

557
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:09,886
Someone call a ride
and get him to the hospital now!
