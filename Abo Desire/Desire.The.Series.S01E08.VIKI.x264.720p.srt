00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:37,902
[Episode 8]

2
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:49,434
Mr. Sheng.

3
00:01:50,503 --> 00:01:52,337
How do you feel?

4
00:02:05,137 --> 00:02:06,805
I'm fine.

5
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,592
Was anyone else hurt?

6
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:15,094
Just one colleague twisted their ankle
on the way out.

7
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:16,462
They've already been approved
for medical leave.

8
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:18,998
No other serious issues.

9
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:20,500
Okay.

10
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,134
Good to hear.

11
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,576
Dr. Wang, what's wrong with Mr. Sheng?

12
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,946
The blood test results are back.

13
00:02:32,946 --> 00:02:36,215
Our preliminary diagnosis
is pheromone dysregulation syndrome.

14
00:02:36,215 --> 00:02:37,583
What?

15
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:38,785
His free-type pheromone level, type T,

16
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:41,087
is more than five times the normal range.

17
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:43,956
That's extremely abnormal for an Alpha.

18
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:48,126
Even Omegas only reach that level during heat.

19
00:02:48,761 --> 00:02:50,997
Is it serious?

20
00:02:50,997 --> 00:02:52,865
How do we treat it?

21
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:57,770
To be honest, given Mr. Sheng's age
and S-class Alpha status,

22
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,772
he shouldn't be developing this.

23
00:02:59,772 --> 00:03:02,175
But considering his high stress,

24
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:05,578
long working hours, and irregular routines,

25
00:03:05,578 --> 00:03:08,981
we have to take the possibility seriously.

26
00:03:10,016 --> 00:03:13,419
For now, I'll prescribe oral medication

27
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:18,825
to prevent extreme overflow
that could harm others.

28
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:20,993
Let's wait until he's hospitalized

29
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,895
and conduct a comprehensive inspection.

30
00:03:22,895 --> 00:03:24,496
Hospitalized?

31
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,667
Can't I just take the meds?

32
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:30,870
Mr. Sheng, I know you're busy,

33
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,439
but your body belongs to you.

34
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,944
Pheromone dysregulation
is a serious endocrine disorder.

35
00:03:37,944 --> 00:03:40,879
We still don't fully understand the cause.

36
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:45,718
And it's already mid-stage
on your first checkup.

37
00:03:45,718 --> 00:03:47,686
Please take this seriously.

38
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:52,457
But I don't have the time to be hospitalized.

39
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,562
It's your body and your time.

40
00:03:56,562 --> 00:03:59,565
But as your doctor, this is my honest advice.

41
00:03:59,565 --> 00:04:02,869
At this point,
I don't think you're fit for discharge.

42
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:04,636
Thank you, Doctor.

43
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:07,472
- Mr. Sheng.
- Let's go.

44
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:12,844
You should stay in the hospital and rest.

45
00:04:18,518 --> 00:04:19,852
Fine.

46
00:04:19,852 --> 00:04:22,355
Then I want daily summaries of meetings

47
00:04:22,355 --> 00:04:24,056
and project updates delivered to me.

48
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:27,159
Don't worry, I'll have everything organized,

49
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:29,362
and report to you every day.

50
00:04:29,362 --> 00:04:30,596
Okay.

51
00:04:30,596 --> 00:04:34,800
And don't tell anyone that I'm hospitalized.

52
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,469
Yes, sir.

53
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:38,070
Good.

54
00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:12,531
Come in.

55
00:06:17,403 --> 00:06:18,904
Mr. Sheng.

56
00:06:18,904 --> 00:06:21,039
These are flowers from Mr. Hua.

57
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:27,747
He's orchid-scented, but he sent me sunflowers.

58
00:06:27,747 --> 00:06:30,738
Sunflowers symbolize sunshine and health.

59
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:35,121
Mr. Sheng, Mr. Hua said he'd like to visit you.

60
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:37,590
An Omega shouldn't be coming here.

61
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,426
Tell him to stay home and rest.

62
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:42,294
Okay, got it.

63
00:06:42,962 --> 00:06:44,730
Put these flowers in a vase.

64
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,331
Okay.

65
00:07:08,988 --> 00:07:10,122
What's up?

66
00:07:10,122 --> 00:07:12,158
Heard Sheng Shao You is sick.

67
00:07:12,158 --> 00:07:13,626
Who told you that?

68
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:15,628
That's none of your business.

69
00:07:15,628 --> 00:07:19,565
Hua Yong, there's a limit to being crazy.

70
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:22,368
Using luring pheromones
to make an S-class Alpha go into heat?

71
00:07:22,368 --> 00:07:23,803
Only you'd think of that.

72
00:07:23,803 --> 00:07:29,041
What, Mr. Hardcore Bachelor gonna teach me
how to pursue my Alpha?

73
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,410
I'm not here to teach you.

74
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,081
Just heard Sheng Shao You's is hospitalized
with pheromone disorder.

75
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:36,615
Just wanted to let you know.

76
00:07:36,615 --> 00:07:39,251
Do not add another case study
to the medical textbooks.

77
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:44,055
No one would expect
an S-class Alpha to go into heat.

78
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:56,334
What are you doing?

79
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:58,570
Making soup.

80
00:07:59,305 --> 00:08:01,073
You can cook?

81
00:08:01,073 --> 00:08:03,074
Planning to poison someone?

82
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,044
Shut up.

83
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:09,415
You're not going to send soup
to Sheng, are you?

84
00:08:09,415 --> 00:08:11,117
So domestic.

85
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:16,389
Shen Wen Lang, you should worry about yourself.

86
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:19,925
Oh, when are you paying back

87
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:21,460
the money you borrowed for your start-up?

88
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,030
Oops, I'm busy.

89
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,266
Talk later, okay?

90
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:31,036
Wishing you and your heat-prone S-class Alpha

91
00:08:31,036 --> 00:08:32,304
a lifetime of happiness together.

92
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,906
Hope you have a child soon.

93
00:08:33,906 --> 00:08:35,975
May you always be of one heart and mind,

94
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:37,909
and grow old together lovingly.

95
00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:50,889
Why are you here?

96
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,192
I told you to stay home.

97
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:54,593
I haven't seen you in so long.

98
00:08:54,593 --> 00:08:57,096
Don't you want to see me?

99
00:08:57,096 --> 00:08:59,265
We video chat every day.

100
00:08:59,265 --> 00:09:01,233
I have pheromone disorder.

101
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:04,569
What if my dominant pheromones hurt you?

102
00:09:05,604 --> 00:09:07,973
I made fish soup for you.

103
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:09,908
Would you like to try some?

104
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,211
Okay.

105
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,047
You shouldn't have come.

106
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:49,148
What if I hurt you?

107
00:09:49,148 --> 00:09:50,449
I won't get hurt.

108
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:51,951
That's nonsense.

109
00:09:51,951 --> 00:09:53,953
An orchid-scented Omega like you?

110
00:09:53,953 --> 00:09:55,920
I could break ten of you with one hand.

111
00:09:58,157 --> 00:10:00,059
Isn't one enough?

112
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:02,827
When plucking flowers, the more the better.

113
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,999
Fine.

114
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:08,267
I understand.

115
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:10,135
What do you understand?

116
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:18,144
Mr. Sheng, I just reviewed
your latest blood test report.

117
00:10:18,144 --> 00:10:20,679
All indicators have improved significantly.

118
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,814
After one more week of observation,

119
00:10:21,814 --> 00:10:25,251
you can be discharged if there's no recurrence.

120
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:27,152
Thanks, Dr. Wang.

121
00:10:27,152 --> 00:10:28,920
You're welcome.

122
00:10:35,027 --> 00:10:38,830
Seems like you're my lucky star.

123
00:10:39,531 --> 00:10:41,199
What?

124
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:46,839
I feel much better after seeing you.

125
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:49,275
I'm not as tired, and my headaches are gone.

126
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:51,677
The doctor says I can be discharged next week.

127
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:53,945
Aren't you my lucky star?

128
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:15,401
Getting discharged on a rest day is perfect.

129
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:16,835
Take a day to rest at home.

130
00:11:16,835 --> 00:11:21,507
There will be live-streamed biopharma
innovation forum on Monday, 10 A.M.

131
00:11:21,507 --> 00:11:25,010
At 2 P.M., you have afternoon tea
with X Holdings' executive.

132
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,547
Don't worry, I'll remind you again.

133
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:29,682
Good.

134
00:11:29,682 --> 00:11:32,151
Thanks, Secretary Chen. Have a good weekend.

135
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:33,752
You, too.

136
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,327
Mr. Sheng, how do you feel?

137
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:42,994
Any discomfort?

138
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,364
I'm a little tired,

139
00:11:45,364 --> 00:11:47,266
but I didn't leak dominant pheromones

140
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:49,268
during the public speech.

141
00:11:49,268 --> 00:11:51,403
Would've made the news otherwise.

142
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:53,439
I'll change your inhibitor patch.

143
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:55,039
Okay.

144
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,119
Mr. Sheng, done with work?

145
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:08,954
Yes, I just finished.

146
00:12:08,954 --> 00:12:10,089
What are you doing?

147
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:11,890
I'm watching TV.

148
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,092
What's on?

149
00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:17,029
Watching you in the forum.

150
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,164
You looked so handsome.

151
00:12:19,164 --> 00:12:22,801
Where are you going next?

152
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:24,370
To see someone I hate.

153
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,970
Huh?

154
00:12:26,772 --> 00:12:30,009
Anyone hated by you is so unlucky.

155
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:31,443
Why say that?

156
00:12:31,443 --> 00:12:35,147
You're so great, everyone wants your favor.

157
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:38,850
So, being hated by you must suck.

158
00:12:41,754 --> 00:12:43,288
My mung bean soup is boiling over.

159
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:46,125
Gotta go. You can have some when you're back.

160
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,725
Bye.

161
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:57,336
Leave.

162
00:12:57,336 --> 00:13:01,507
Can't be late
for my first afternoon tea with Mr. Sheng.

163
00:13:01,507 --> 00:13:03,107
Yes, sir.

164
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:09,281
Such a fuss,
with inspectors as patrol officers.

165
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:13,318
Is the guy from X Holdings
some overlord from Country P?

166
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:16,387
Mr. Sheng.

167
00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:19,191
Hope you've been well.

168
00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:20,726
Thanks to your master's hospitality,

169
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:22,494
it's my first afternoon tea here

170
00:13:22,494 --> 00:13:25,397
with inspectors standing guard
and commissioners directing traffic.

171
00:13:25,397 --> 00:13:27,633
Even a small country president's private visit

172
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:30,803
wouldn't have this much fanfare.

173
00:13:30,803 --> 00:13:32,104
You flatter us.

174
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:35,306
We owe it all to your city's kindness.
This way, please.

175
00:13:38,911 --> 00:13:41,413
Have you thought about how this will end?

176
00:13:41,413 --> 00:13:42,714
I have.

177
00:13:42,714 --> 00:13:44,016
I love him.

178
00:13:44,016 --> 00:13:46,285
I could play an Omega beside him forever.

179
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:48,954
What if he wants to permanently mark you?

180
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:50,956
I'll remove my gland,

181
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:54,359
say it was injured and I became a Beta.

182
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:56,428
Remove it? Don't say that so easily.

183
00:13:56,428 --> 00:13:58,030
You think it's tonsillectomy?

184
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,832
Accidental pheromone gland injury

185
00:13:59,832 --> 00:14:01,066
has a zero-percent survival rate.

186
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:04,737
My body functions better than S-class Alphas.

187
00:14:04,737 --> 00:14:07,772
I might survive.

188
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,409
You might survive?

189
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:12,111
You're completely insane.

190
00:14:12,111 --> 00:14:15,347
All this trouble for love.

191
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:17,115
How touching.

192
00:14:18,117 --> 00:14:19,918
It's nothing.

193
00:14:19,918 --> 00:14:22,520
This way, Mr. Sheng.

194
00:14:29,394 --> 00:14:31,663
Please have a seat, Mr. Sheng.

195
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:35,801
These are the key heads
of X Holdings' pharmaceutical division.

196
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:40,772
Our boss said you'd
share common ground with them.

197
00:14:46,612 --> 00:14:48,747
I'll leave you to it.

198
00:14:48,747 --> 00:14:50,548
Excuse me for a moment.

199
00:14:52,885 --> 00:14:55,854
Secretary Chen, since there's no seat for you,

200
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:58,157
please stand for a while.

201
00:14:58,157 --> 00:15:01,226
Sir, Mr. Sheng from Sheng Fang Biotech is here.

202
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:06,030
Chang Yu, bring a chair for Mr. Sheng's team.

203
00:15:25,918 --> 00:15:28,486
Secretary Chen, please sit.

204
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,094
Pin Ming, sit when told.

205
00:15:36,094 --> 00:15:37,695
Yes, sir.

206
00:15:42,434 --> 00:15:45,470
Mr. Sheng, why not take this opportunity

207
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,638
to introduce your company?

208
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,913
Didn't know I came for a job interview.

209
00:15:57,216 --> 00:15:58,917
What are you saying, Mr. Sheng?

210
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:03,589
X Holdings had an industry exchange conference.

211
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:08,026
Sheng Fang's absence was a real pity.

212
00:16:08,026 --> 00:16:15,200
We've invited you today
to build basic mutual understanding.

213
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,904
X Holdings is a global industry leader.

214
00:16:18,904 --> 00:16:23,307
It's our honor that you wish
to learn about Sheng Fang.

215
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:27,346
Pin Ming.

216
00:16:27,346 --> 00:16:28,813
Yes.

217
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:33,352
Hello, everyone. I'm Chen Pin Ming.

218
00:16:33,352 --> 00:16:35,687
I'm head of Mr. Sheng's secretariat.

219
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:40,392
Allow me to introduce Sheng Fang Biotech.

220
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:42,361
Founded over 20 years ago,

221
00:16:42,361 --> 00:16:45,764
we specialize in bio pharmaceutical research,

222
00:16:45,764 --> 00:16:48,834
holding one of the most targeted drug patents

223
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:53,205
in Jiang Hu and nationwide.

224
00:16:53,205 --> 00:16:57,476
Next, I'll detail our targeted drugs.

225
00:16:57,476 --> 00:17:02,414
Look at your Mr. Sheng,
talking and charming on the surface,

226
00:17:02,414 --> 00:17:05,784
but arrogantly treating everyone with contempt.

227
00:17:05,784 --> 00:17:09,321
Would it kill him to make an introduction?

228
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:13,959
Wen Lang, can't you stop trashing my Alpha?

229
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:18,297
Your Alpha? Is he really yours?

230
00:17:18,297 --> 00:17:20,432
Is he really yours to claim?

231
00:17:20,432 --> 00:17:22,100
Chang Yu said at the last banquet

232
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,870
an Omega named Shu Xin

233
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,372
called herself Sheng Shao You's girlfriend.

234
00:17:27,372 --> 00:17:29,440
Do you know about that?

235
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,045
Sheng Fang's patented
active targeted drug delivery

236
00:17:33,045 --> 00:17:38,083
based on blood circulation
and penetration technology

237
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,251
is widely used in the industry.

238
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:41,320
Orchid scent, it's Hua Yong.

239
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,655
No, this pheromone is too dominant.

240
00:17:43,655 --> 00:17:44,923
It isn't Hua Yong.

241
00:17:44,923 --> 00:17:47,358
It's an S-class Alpha's...

242
00:17:48,894 --> 00:17:50,329
Luring pheromones?

243
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:53,331
Targeted, too? Are you crazy?

244
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:59,533
Next, I'll introduce our core technology.

245
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:03,943
Sheng Fang Biotech has the worldwide patent
for the fourth generation CRISPR.

246
00:18:03,943 --> 00:18:07,021
It is three times more effecient
than regular CRISPR models.

247
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:09,648
It's MOP rate is lower than 0.1.

248
00:18:09,648 --> 00:18:11,850
Mr. Sheng, what's wrong?

249
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,552
You look pale, Mr. Sheng.

250
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,921
Mr. Sheng.

251
00:18:18,991 --> 00:18:20,591
Mr. Sheng.

252
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,145
Secretary Chang, it's a misunderstanding.

253
00:18:40,145 --> 00:18:43,215
Mr. Sheng has been suffering
from pheromone disorder recently.

254
00:18:43,215 --> 00:18:45,650
Shut up! Hands on your head!

255
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:02,401
Secretary Chang, we meant no offense.

256
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:05,871
Besides, if there's a misunderstanding,

257
00:19:05,871 --> 00:19:10,242
X Holdings shouldn't be
killing anyone in broad daylight.

258
00:19:10,242 --> 00:19:11,843
Quiet.

259
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:34,765
Boss.

260
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:37,836
He fainted.

261
00:19:37,836 --> 00:19:38,837
Yes.

262
00:19:38,837 --> 00:19:41,606
Sir, please trust us.
Mr. Sheng didn't do it on purpose.

263
00:19:41,606 --> 00:19:43,508
- He…
- What if he did?

264
00:19:43,508 --> 00:19:45,343
What if he didn't?

265
00:19:45,343 --> 00:19:46,911
But...

266
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:51,716
Are the room and doctor ready?

267
00:19:51,716 --> 00:19:54,652
Yes, all arranged.

268
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:22,647
Pitiful.

269
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,384
An S-class Alpha like you

270
00:20:26,384 --> 00:20:30,688
would never have thought
you'd go into heat like an Omega.

271
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:39,130
No wonder you released
dominant pheromones unconsciously from panic.

272
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,039
Since you look so handsome today,

273
00:20:49,508 --> 00:20:51,409
let me help you.

274
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,200
I knew you'd do something crazy.

275
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,402
I should've stayed away.

276
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:21,072
You don't know how much
Sheng Shao You's dominant pheromones hurt me.

277
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:23,975
No, I don't feel it.

278
00:21:27,312 --> 00:21:30,315
Using targeted luring pheromones in public?

279
00:21:30,315 --> 00:21:34,497
Hua Yong, any S-class Alpha
with an ounce of shame

280
00:21:34,497 --> 00:21:37,756
wouldn't use such advanced abilities openly.

281
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:41,826
You already said it. "S-class Alphas".

282
00:21:41,826 --> 00:21:43,894
What's that to me?

283
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:49,935
Hua Yong, have some decency.

284
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:52,671
Inducing an S-class Alpha
to have their heat in public...

285
00:21:52,671 --> 00:21:56,808
If word gets out, you'll be dissected in a lab.

286
00:21:56,808 --> 00:21:59,076
Don't be naive.

287
00:21:59,711 --> 00:22:05,883
Whether an Omega or an Alpha,
anyone I want becomes mine.

288
00:22:12,324 --> 00:22:18,597
To make that proud S-class Alpha
my exclusive Omega,

289
00:22:18,597 --> 00:22:20,966
I need some tricks

290
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:23,068
Mr. Sheng is so precious.

291
00:22:23,068 --> 00:22:26,504
He has more admirers than ants.

292
00:22:26,504 --> 00:22:30,008
Without some tricks, I'd never get close.

293
00:22:30,008 --> 00:22:32,943
Precious? Is he a diamond or encrusted?

294
00:22:33,878 --> 00:22:36,748
Wen Lang, envy gets you nowhere.

295
00:22:36,748 --> 00:22:38,482
Learn from me.

296
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:50,027
Gotta go. Mr. Sheng is waking up.

297
00:23:12,317 --> 00:23:15,886
Mr. Sheng, how do you feel?

298
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:32,203
Where is this?

299
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,606
This is a suite at X Hotel.

300
00:23:34,606 --> 00:23:37,075
You had pheromone disorder,

301
00:23:37,075 --> 00:23:40,245
released dominant pheromones, then fainted.

302
00:23:40,245 --> 00:23:44,616
X Holdings arranged this room and a doctor.

303
00:23:44,616 --> 00:23:46,918
The doctor wanted to inject an inhibitor,

304
00:23:46,918 --> 00:23:49,888
but I refused to ensure safety.

305
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,256
Got it.

306
00:23:51,256 --> 00:23:54,158
Did you see that person's face?

307
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:56,795
They had guns.

308
00:23:56,795 --> 00:24:00,998
Before that man appeared,
bodyguards blindfolded me.

309
00:24:03,134 --> 00:24:06,004
Despicable tactics.

310
00:24:06,004 --> 00:24:07,771
Someone's coming.

311
00:24:18,616 --> 00:24:21,052
Don't worry, Secretary Chen.

312
00:24:21,052 --> 00:24:23,955
Earlier, my boss was present,

313
00:24:23,955 --> 00:24:27,125
and Mr. Sheng released
dominant pheromones suddenly.

314
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:29,160
We had to take precautions.

315
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:34,165
Secretary Chang, thank your boss
for the room and the doctor.

316
00:24:34,165 --> 00:24:36,034
You're welcome.

317
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:42,173
I'm here to say my boss won't pursue this.

318
00:24:42,173 --> 00:24:45,476
You can leave anytime.

319
00:24:50,048 --> 00:24:52,517
Mr. Sheng, rest well.

320
00:24:52,517 --> 00:24:55,352
See you soon.

321
00:25:13,872 --> 00:25:15,774
You're back late.

322
00:25:15,774 --> 00:25:17,641
Did everything go well?

323
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:30,254
What's wrong?

324
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:33,524
Ran into a lunatic.

325
00:25:43,635 --> 00:25:44,869
Did you eat?

326
00:25:44,869 --> 00:25:47,571
Yes. What about you?

327
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,875
I went straight to the office.

328
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:53,211
Didn't have time to eat.

329
00:25:53,211 --> 00:25:54,946
I'll make you some noodles.

330
00:25:54,946 --> 00:25:57,916
Or do you want the mung bean soup
I made this afternoon?

331
00:25:57,916 --> 00:26:00,050
Do you want it hot or cold?

332
00:26:01,152 --> 00:26:02,387
Either's fine.

333
00:26:02,387 --> 00:26:03,655
Okay.

334
00:26:03,655 --> 00:26:05,890
I also made double-boiled conch
with cordyceps flowers.

335
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:08,393
I can use it as broth for the noodles.

336
00:26:08,393 --> 00:26:10,961
Or would you rather have rice?

337
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:15,967
You know how to make soup?

338
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:19,204
- Yeah.
- You're good at everything.

339
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:20,872
I'm not that good.

340
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:22,707
I dozed off this afternoon

341
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:24,075
and let the first pot boil dry.

342
00:26:24,075 --> 00:26:26,510
This is a fresh batch.

343
00:26:27,111 --> 00:26:29,647
Go sit on the couch.

344
00:26:29,647 --> 00:26:30,582
I'll heat up the broth and make noodles.

345
00:26:30,582 --> 00:26:32,149
It won't take long.

346
00:26:55,807 --> 00:26:58,042
Want to join me for a bowl?

347
00:26:58,042 --> 00:27:01,479
Okay, I'll have some mung bean soup first.

348
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:03,214
If you like it, you can ask for more.

349
00:27:03,214 --> 00:27:04,415
Okay.

350
00:27:18,563 --> 00:27:21,332
Tough meeting this afternoon?

351
00:27:21,332 --> 00:27:22,567
Yes.

352
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:23,735
Offended someone crazy.

353
00:27:23,735 --> 00:27:25,536
I offended him slightly,

354
00:27:25,536 --> 00:27:27,906
and he issued a statement immediately,

355
00:27:27,906 --> 00:27:31,442
saying he won't cooperate
with Sheng Fang Biotech short-term.

356
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:34,479
Now, everyone in the industry
is asking about it.

357
00:27:34,479 --> 00:27:37,948
The PR team is still working overtime.

358
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,685
How could this happen?

359
00:27:40,685 --> 00:27:42,554
Cowardly bastard.

360
00:27:42,554 --> 00:27:45,556
Better not let me find out what he looks like.

361
00:27:47,091 --> 00:27:49,327
You don't know who he is?

362
00:27:49,327 --> 00:27:50,962
Yeah.

363
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:53,030
Few have seen him.

364
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:57,968
No one knows his appearance.

365
00:28:00,438 --> 00:28:02,240
A person's face reflects the heart.

366
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,443
With such a filthy heart,
he can't be good-looking.

367
00:28:05,443 --> 00:28:08,313
Yes, you're right.

368
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:09,414
So, what now?

369
00:28:09,414 --> 00:28:10,715
Will it have a big impact?

370
00:28:10,715 --> 00:28:12,317
No.

371
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:13,559
Before the market closed,

372
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:18,056
someone spread rumors that Sheng Fang
has cash flow issues, even bankruptcy.

373
00:28:18,056 --> 00:28:21,960
It caused stock fluctuations at first,

374
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,495
but PR has publicly denied it.

375
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,130
It's no big deal.

376
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,399
Okay. That's good.

377
00:28:58,096 --> 00:29:00,431
Mr. Sheng, it's me.

378
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:03,334
What is it?

379
00:29:03,334 --> 00:29:06,004
Secretary Gao from HS called

380
00:29:06,004 --> 00:29:11,608
saying Mr. Shen wants to talk urgently.

381
00:29:14,078 --> 00:29:16,814
I've got nothing to say to a bastard.

382
00:29:16,814 --> 00:29:19,550
I'm busy, don't bother me with this again.

383
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,854
But... Shen Wen Lang said
he wants to talk to you

384
00:29:22,854 --> 00:29:25,189
about the targeted drug patent.

385
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:30,495
That's all they have of value.

386
00:29:30,495 --> 00:29:32,496
There's nothing to discuss.

387
00:29:33,164 --> 00:29:35,333
I don't believe

388
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:40,370
X Holdings can develop drugs
that Sheng Fang can't.

389
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,508
But Secretary Gao said

390
00:29:43,508 --> 00:29:46,110
if you agree to Mr. Shen's terms,

391
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:49,914
HS is willing to do an equity swap

392
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:51,115
and merge the companies.

393
00:29:51,115 --> 00:29:52,950
And in the future...

394
00:30:02,193 --> 00:30:03,928
Mr. Sheng.

395
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:05,763
It's a boring proposal.

396
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:07,364
Ignore them.

397
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:31,556
The terms are very favorable.

398
00:30:31,556 --> 00:30:33,924
Please reconsider it seriously.

399
00:31:31,215 --> 00:31:34,152
Hello, Yu Shan.

400
00:31:34,152 --> 00:31:36,818
Hey, Shao You.

401
00:31:36,818 --> 00:31:38,256
It's been a long time.

402
00:31:38,256 --> 00:31:41,392
You haven't been hanging out with us.

403
00:31:41,392 --> 00:31:43,961
You know I've been busy,

404
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:45,496
I have no time.

405
00:31:45,496 --> 00:31:49,167
Saw the news last night.

406
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:51,269
Who would spread such rumors?

407
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:53,271
So pointless.

408
00:31:53,271 --> 00:31:56,007
Let me know if you need help

409
00:31:56,007 --> 00:31:57,575
I got you, bro.

410
00:31:57,575 --> 00:31:58,976
Thanks, Yu Shan.

411
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,278
It's under control.

412
00:32:00,278 --> 00:32:02,847
Good, good.

413
00:32:02,847 --> 00:32:04,482
Oh right, Shao You.

414
00:32:04,482 --> 00:32:07,718
Wen Lang called to say
there's been a misunderstanding.

415
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:10,320
He wants to have dinner to clear it up.

416
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,791
Hello?

417
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:15,226
Shao You?

418
00:32:15,226 --> 00:32:17,228
Yes.

419
00:32:17,228 --> 00:32:20,398
Listen, it's better to bury the hatchet.

420
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:22,200
We're in the same circle,

421
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,368
so we'll always run into each other.

422
00:32:24,368 --> 00:32:26,571
Let me host a dinner.

423
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:28,271
How about that?

424
00:32:28,873 --> 00:32:32,443
Yu Shan, don't bother.

425
00:32:32,443 --> 00:32:35,513
I can't stand that guy.

426
00:32:35,513 --> 00:32:38,015
Seeing him ruins my appetite.

427
00:32:38,015 --> 00:32:40,651
I just want to kill him.

428
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,288
Truth is, if murder weren't illegal,

429
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:47,124
he'd have eaten his last meal months ago.

430
00:32:47,124 --> 00:32:51,329
His grave would be covered by weeds by now.

431
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:52,363
That serious?

432
00:32:52,363 --> 00:32:53,964
Yes.

433
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,567
Forget it then.

434
00:32:56,567 --> 00:32:58,169
My bad, bro.

435
00:32:58,169 --> 00:33:00,238
I didn't know the whole story.

436
00:33:00,238 --> 00:33:02,173
Wen Lang called me multiple times last night

437
00:33:02,173 --> 00:33:04,041
asking me to mediate.

438
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:07,311
I just think if friends
can sit down for a meal,

439
00:33:07,311 --> 00:33:09,480
maybe some problems can be worked out.

440
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,585
Yu Shan, there's no misunderstanding.

441
00:33:14,585 --> 00:33:19,257
I'll only have dinner with him when he's dead.

442
00:33:19,257 --> 00:33:20,958
I'll send a cash gift for the funeral

443
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:22,826
and feast for three days.

444
00:33:23,494 --> 00:33:25,229
What are you saying?

445
00:33:25,229 --> 00:33:27,865
All right, I won't push.

446
00:33:27,865 --> 00:33:30,534
Let me know if you need anything.

447
00:33:30,534 --> 00:33:34,772
After all, those Country P folks
are new friends.

448
00:33:34,772 --> 00:33:40,243
We've known each other forever,
and we're closer than family.

449
00:33:40,945 --> 00:33:42,813
Yeah.

450
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:44,849
If there's anything you can help with,

451
00:33:44,849 --> 00:33:46,684
I'll definitely let you know.

452
00:33:46,684 --> 00:33:47,785
Thanks.

453
00:33:47,785 --> 00:33:49,754
Let's meet after this chaos.

454
00:33:49,754 --> 00:33:51,655
Definitely.

455
00:34:15,046 --> 00:34:18,115
Can't this wait till tomorrow at the office?

456
00:34:18,115 --> 00:34:21,084
Mr. Sheng, the chairman
is in critical condition.

457
00:34:24,121 --> 00:34:25,956
Sheng Shao You.

458
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:28,793
- How dare you show up.
- Second Young Master.

459
00:34:28,793 --> 00:34:30,194
Look at what you've done to the company!

460
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:31,729
the stock has hit the limit down.

461
00:34:31,729 --> 00:34:33,264
How dare you face Dad!

462
00:34:33,264 --> 00:34:35,432
Don't touch me.

463
00:34:36,734 --> 00:34:38,335
What?

464
00:34:38,936 --> 00:34:42,506
Can't I scold him after he ruined the company?

465
00:34:43,574 --> 00:34:45,876
Sheng Shao You, listen.

466
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:52,049
If anything happens to Dad,
it's all your fault.

467
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:54,585
You're so great.

468
00:34:54,585 --> 00:34:57,754
Dad gave you all the shares,
and this is how you repay him?

469
00:34:58,356 --> 00:35:00,757
You made him sick.

470
00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:05,162
You think you deserve to visit him now?

471
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:08,332
You don't.

472
00:35:08,332 --> 00:35:11,568
Get lost!

473
00:35:14,772 --> 00:35:16,973
Why don't I deserve to be here?

474
00:35:18,309 --> 00:35:21,746
This company was founded by my mom and dad.

475
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:27,885
Without me, you think you and your mom
could live like this?

476
00:35:27,885 --> 00:35:31,856
With your pig brain
only good for eating and gambling,

477
00:35:31,856 --> 00:35:34,091
you'd be begging on the streets.

478
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:35,760
Bastard.

479
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,761
Get lost.

480
00:36:01,385 --> 00:36:04,487
Parasites should know their place.

481
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:10,561
Don't ever challenge me.

482
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:12,797
It won't end well for you.

483
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:15,765
Sheng... Sheng Shao You.

484
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:19,069
We....

485
00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:22,173
We have the same father.

486
00:36:22,173 --> 00:36:24,507
You're only two years older.

487
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:28,946
We're both Alphas.

488
00:36:28,946 --> 00:36:31,749
But why?

489
00:36:31,749 --> 00:36:34,718
Why do you inherit everything

490
00:36:34,718 --> 00:36:40,324
while I'm stuck following you like a parasite?

491
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:43,627
Is it because you're S-class, but I'm B-class?

492
00:36:43,627 --> 00:36:45,930
It's not fair.

493
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:50,234
Your mother knew Dad was married,

494
00:36:50,234 --> 00:36:52,836
yet she had you anyway.

495
00:36:53,704 --> 00:36:56,640
Was that fair to my mother?

496
00:36:59,743 --> 00:37:01,411
Fair?

497
00:37:02,613 --> 00:37:07,117
If there were any fairness, you wouldn't exist.

498
00:37:07,785 --> 00:37:12,123
Sheng Shao Qing,
stop disgracing the Sheng family.

499
00:37:12,123 --> 00:37:14,958
Go back to being a playboy.

500
00:37:31,509 --> 00:37:33,777
Make way, please.

501
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:36,479
This way.

502
00:37:37,248 --> 00:37:39,482
- Doctor!
- Please wait outside.

503
00:37:48,067 --> 00:37:50,033
[Want do you want for dinner tonight?]

504
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:56,968
[Anything's fine, you can choose]

505
00:37:57,367 --> 00:37:59,934
[You recalled a message.]

506
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,844
Mr. Sheng.

507
00:38:05,176 --> 00:38:07,645
Why are you awake so early?

508
00:38:07,645 --> 00:38:11,282
I woke up and couldn't fall back asleep
when I found you weren't here.

509
00:38:11,282 --> 00:38:13,450
Why not?

510
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,586
I'm worried about you.

511
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:18,489
Did something happen?
Why did you leave so late at night?

512
00:38:18,489 --> 00:38:21,692
My father had some issues, but don't worry.

513
00:38:21,692 --> 00:38:23,327
I'll handle it

514
00:38:23,327 --> 00:38:24,929
I'll wait for you to come back.

515
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:27,364
No, go to sleep first.

516
00:38:27,364 --> 00:38:29,799
I can't sleep without you.

517
00:38:30,501 --> 00:38:32,002
Are you still at the age

518
00:38:32,002 --> 00:38:34,405
where you need someone to coax you to sleep?

519
00:38:34,405 --> 00:38:36,874
You don't like coaxing people?

520
00:38:36,874 --> 00:38:39,609
I don't like it.

521
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:43,147
But I can coax you.

522
00:38:43,147 --> 00:38:45,182
You don't need to spend time on me.

523
00:38:45,182 --> 00:38:46,850
Rest more if you have time.

524
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,585
I'll wait for you to come back.

525
00:39:00,798 --> 00:39:02,833
- Mr. Sheng.
- Doctor Wang.

526
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:05,135
Your father is out of danger for now.

527
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:07,738
No problems temporarily.

528
00:39:07,738 --> 00:39:09,006
Thank you, Doctor.

529
00:39:09,006 --> 00:39:11,675
But his condition is deteriorating.

530
00:39:11,675 --> 00:39:14,578
Pheromone gland tumors are hormone-sensitive.

531
00:39:14,578 --> 00:39:19,149
Pheromones are vital for Alphas and Omegas.

532
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:22,953
It's unlike prostate or breast cancer
which are treatable with hormones.

533
00:39:22,953 --> 00:39:27,758
His tumor was originally in situ
and not spreading,

534
00:39:27,758 --> 00:39:29,426
but now,

535
00:39:29,426 --> 00:39:31,662
it's infiltrating surrounding tissues.

536
00:39:31,662 --> 00:39:33,163
Without a targeted drug,

537
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:34,598
once it spreads,

538
00:39:34,598 --> 00:39:36,900
it will reach severe stages.

539
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,070
Even with a drug then,

540
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,905
it may be too late

541
00:39:41,905 --> 00:39:44,408
I understand.

542
00:39:44,408 --> 00:39:46,176
A pharmaceutical friend said this.

543
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:49,246
X Holdings' targeted drug
has completed formulation

544
00:39:49,246 --> 00:39:50,981
with excellent results.

545
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:52,650
If we can contact the person in charge

546
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,451
to get the drug early,

547
00:39:54,451 --> 00:39:58,455
it would help the chairman significantly.

548
00:40:11,435 --> 00:40:13,871
I went grocery shopping for dinner.

549
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:16,073
If you want something special,

550
00:40:16,073 --> 00:40:18,575
text me when you see this note.

551
00:40:18,575 --> 00:40:21,444
I'll pick it up on the way. Hua Yong.

552
00:40:30,921 --> 00:40:32,356
Hello, Mr. Sheng.

553
00:40:32,356 --> 00:40:33,724
Are you done?

554
00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:36,092
Yes. I just got home

555
00:40:37,594 --> 00:40:39,697
I've bought the groceries
and will be back soon.

556
00:40:39,697 --> 00:40:42,800
Anything specific you want me to buy?

557
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,468
No.

558
00:40:44,468 --> 00:40:47,171
Shall I send a driver to pick you up?

559
00:40:47,171 --> 00:40:50,039
No, the subway is convenient.

560
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:57,681
Why leave a note instead of messaging directly?

561
00:40:57,681 --> 00:40:59,249
I wasn't sure if you were busy

562
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,217
and didn't want to disturb you.

563
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:03,754
Mr. Sheng, it's my turn to pay.

564
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:06,122
I'll hang up. See you soon.

565
00:41:06,924 --> 00:41:08,359
Okay.

566
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:09,959
See you.

567
00:41:21,572 --> 00:41:23,073
Without a targeted drug,

568
00:41:23,073 --> 00:41:24,508
once the tumor spreads,

569
00:41:24,508 --> 00:41:26,343
it will reach severe stages.

570
00:41:26,343 --> 00:41:31,748
Even with a drug then, it may be too late.

571
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:53,834
[Chang Yu]

572
00:41:55,038 --> 00:41:57,274
Mr. Sheng, I just finished shopping

573
00:41:57,274 --> 00:41:59,909
and will be back soon.

574
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:07,217
Mr. Sheng, I'm on the subway
and will be home shortly.

575
00:42:17,761 --> 00:42:21,031
Boss, Mr. Sheng called.

576
00:42:21,031 --> 00:42:23,133
Should we call back soon?

577
00:42:23,133 --> 00:42:24,568
No.

578
00:42:24,568 --> 00:42:27,638
He's probably asking about the targeted drug.

579
00:42:27,638 --> 00:42:29,473
Call back in two hours.

580
00:42:29,473 --> 00:42:30,840
Understood.

581
00:42:33,444 --> 00:42:36,647
The drug formulation just finished.

582
00:42:36,647 --> 00:42:38,115
The maximum dosage test for human application

583
00:42:38,115 --> 00:42:42,453
can start earliest on the day after tomorrow.

584
00:42:42,453 --> 00:42:44,053
Got it.

585
00:42:44,955 --> 00:42:47,691
I've already hinted to Wen Lang.

586
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:51,495
Tell Mr. Sheng that
the drug's person in charge will contact him.

587
00:42:51,495 --> 00:42:52,929
Yes.

588
00:42:54,164 --> 00:42:57,568
Boss, you oversaw this personally.

589
00:42:57,568 --> 00:43:01,004
The research teams worldwide
rushed the progress

590
00:43:01,004 --> 00:43:04,441
to expedite it for Mr. Sheng's father.

591
00:43:04,441 --> 00:43:10,214
Wouldn't it be a pity
if he doesn't know your intentions?

592
00:43:10,214 --> 00:43:12,482
It doesn't matter if he knows.

593
00:43:13,317 --> 00:43:18,521
I never wanted his gratitude,
so there's nothing worth regretting.

594
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:50,120
I forgot my book in the bedroom.

595
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,754
I'm going to get it.

596
00:44:04,467 --> 00:44:06,133
[Chang Yu]

597
00:44:21,385 --> 00:44:23,455
Hello, Secretary Chang.

598
00:44:23,455 --> 00:44:25,022
Mr. Sheng.

599
00:44:25,022 --> 00:44:27,324
Why the sudden call?

600
00:44:27,324 --> 00:44:30,727
I need your advice on something.

601
00:44:30,727 --> 00:44:32,929
Is it convenient to talk now?

602
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:36,599
Go ahead.

603
00:44:37,267 --> 00:44:41,505
I heard X Holdings'
targeted pheromone gland cancer drug

604
00:44:41,505 --> 00:44:43,574
has completed formulation.

605
00:44:43,574 --> 00:44:45,609
News travels fast.

606
00:44:45,609 --> 00:44:46,910
Yes.

607
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:50,013
Our drug is indeed near clinical trials.

608
00:44:50,013 --> 00:44:53,015
Why the sudden interest?

609
00:44:55,953 --> 00:44:57,787
To be frank,

610
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:00,990
my father needs this drug.

611
00:45:01,992 --> 00:45:05,796
You mean Sheng Fang's chairman?

612
00:45:05,796 --> 00:45:07,931
Yes.

613
00:45:07,931 --> 00:45:10,433
He's been on medical leave.

614
00:45:11,234 --> 00:45:13,270
It's pheromone gland cancer.

615
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:18,008
Secretary Chang, I know your formula
is still confidential.

616
00:45:18,008 --> 00:45:22,479
But I'm not calling as a biopharm CEO today.

617
00:45:22,479 --> 00:45:27,049
I'm calling as a son
begging for help for my father.

618
00:45:31,888 --> 00:45:33,856
Please help me.
