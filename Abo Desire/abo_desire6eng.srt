2
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:43,242
Did you spread the word like I told you?

3
00:01:43,242 --> 00:01:44,477
Yes.

4
00:01:44,477 --> 00:01:46,612
We've got a tail, persistent little rodent.

5
00:01:46,612 --> 00:01:49,448
Probably snuck into the hotel by now.

6
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,586
How long will these injuries last?

7
00:01:58,257 --> 00:02:00,193
You should thank your rut and mating disorder.

8
00:02:00,193 --> 00:02:02,628
They drained most of your stamina.

9
00:02:02,628 --> 00:02:05,898
With your freakish healing ability,

10
00:02:05,898 --> 00:02:09,201
it's a miracle that you're still alive.

11
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:12,038
He heals too fast.

12
00:02:12,038 --> 00:02:14,374
What if Mr. Sheng can't see it?

13
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:16,409
Then let him take you home.

14
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:18,512
Give Chang Yu a break.

15
00:02:18,512 --> 00:02:20,780
Let's get down to business.

16
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,281
After this meeting,

17
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:24,450
I need to go to the hospital.

18
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,753
Thanks to Sheng Shao You,

19
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:30,790
my secretary's hospitalized
and still hasn't woken up.

20
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,992
Secretary Gao?

21
00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:34,627
Yeah.

22
00:02:34,627 --> 00:02:37,029
Orchid scent, should be here.

23
00:02:37,029 --> 00:02:38,231
Found him yet?

24
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:39,832
Not yet.

25
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:43,736
Oh, Wen Lang.

26
00:02:43,736 --> 00:02:45,538
I heard from the pharmaceutical
development team

27
00:02:45,538 --> 00:02:48,941
that the targeted drug has already
entered the formulation development stage.

28
00:02:48,941 --> 00:02:51,544
Overall, progress has been going smoothly,

29
00:02:51,544 --> 00:02:55,214
and they've also secured special approval.

30
00:02:56,616 --> 00:02:59,785
That's enough for today.

31
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:02,754
I'm leaving.

32
00:03:09,395 --> 00:03:13,198
Mr. Sheng will harrass you again.

33
00:03:15,601 --> 00:03:17,770
Better rest up.

34
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,772
Get tough enough to take a beating.

35
00:03:19,772 --> 00:03:22,641
You think I need to get tough for that?

36
00:03:25,077 --> 00:03:26,979
Psycho.

37
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,185
We'll meet again soon.

38
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:53,171
These days have been rough.

39
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,476
He used to be with Sheng Shao You every day.

40
00:03:56,476 --> 00:03:59,879
Leaving a rut partner is hard enough,

41
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,782
plus dealing with these assholes.

42
00:04:02,782 --> 00:04:06,385
With his temper,

43
00:04:07,653 --> 00:04:09,955
enduring this must have drained him.

44
00:04:11,457 --> 00:04:13,159
Great summary.

45
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,861
Don't do that again.

46
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:16,028
Boss is in a mood.

47
00:04:16,028 --> 00:04:17,196
You might get dragged down.

48
00:04:17,196 --> 00:04:18,698
I spotted a target.

49
00:04:18,698 --> 00:04:20,833
If you can take out Shen Wen Lang,

50
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,568
I'll add another 100 million.

51
00:04:22,568 --> 00:04:24,470
Mr. Sheng, I'm a detective,

52
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,038
not a hitman.

53
00:04:26,038 --> 00:04:28,808
Bring him back by any means.

54
00:04:28,808 --> 00:04:30,409
Don't worry.

55
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,891
Don't be afraid.

56
00:05:23,462 --> 00:05:25,364
Mr. Sheng sent me.

57
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,814
He sent you to take me home?

58
00:05:41,814 --> 00:05:44,483
Yes. It's not safe here.

59
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:46,852
Let's go.

60
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:53,893
How do I know you're not lying?

61
00:05:53,893 --> 00:05:57,063
Mr. Sheng, the target
wants to confirm with you.

62
00:05:57,063 --> 00:05:59,832
Was it really you who sent me here?

63
00:05:59,832 --> 00:06:02,368
Put him on the phone.

64
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:03,602
Here you are.

65
00:06:12,945 --> 00:06:16,014
Yong, it's me, Sheng Shao You.

66

67
00:06:36,135 --> 00:06:37,370
Where are you?

68
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,238
Almost there.

69
00:06:39,238 --> 00:06:40,406
Okay.

70
00:06:40,406 --> 00:06:42,441
I'll go downstairs now.

71
00:06:43,776 --> 00:06:46,479
Mr. Sheng, please prepare a long coat.

72
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,080
Fine.

73

Show some professionalism.

74

Don't be afraid.

77

I'll gouge his eyes out.

Yes, it's me.

00:08:49,402 --> 00:08:51,137
See?

94
00:08:51,137 --> 00:08:53,139
It's me.

95
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:56,142
- Mr. Sheng.
- I came to take you home.

Is it really you?

97

Hua Yong, I'm sorry.

102

I was too slow and made you wait too long.

You have too many injuries and can't get wet.

106

Okay.

Hua Yong, I won't do anything.

117

I just want to check on you.

118

If you won't see a doctor,
let me inspect your wounds.

119
00:11:27,026 --> 00:11:29,561
I need to know how bad they are.

for glandular cancer, don't you?

You don't want this?

131

Don't think about that now.

But if you don't want it...

Why don't you sleep a little longer?

I just can't.

148

Don't mention it.

149
00:16:02,968 --> 00:16:06,471
I already installed the usual apps for you

150
00:16:06,471 --> 00:16:09,007
and got you a new SIM card.

151

Okay.

you fell behind on work looking for me.

You must have a lot to do.

158

You don't need to stay with me.

159

I'll be fine.

160

I can't leave you alone.

161

Why?

162
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,659

00:18:33,485 --> 00:18:36,821
but Hua Yong is the only one who interests me.

174
00:18:49,034 --> 00:18:50,668
Mr. Sheng.

175
00:18:52,671 --> 00:18:54,439
Your face...

176
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:56,207
Got it from a scrape.

177
00:19:06,685 --> 00:19:08,653
Did you eat dinner?

178
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:15,994
Yeah.

179
00:19:15,994 --> 00:19:17,695
What'd you eat?

180
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:22,034
Is the temperature
of the air conditioner too low?

181
00:19:22,034 --> 00:19:24,135
Your hands are freezing.

182
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,452
Does it still hurt?

183
00:19:40,452 --> 00:19:42,053
Nah.

184
00:19:45,357 --> 00:19:47,758
Why the smile today?

185
00:19:51,596 --> 00:19:55,967
Because you look cute with a bruise.

186
00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:02,373
Cute?

187
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:05,043
Yes.

188
00:20:05,043 --> 00:20:06,878
Very cute.

189
00:20:08,447 --> 00:20:10,047
Hua Yong.

190
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:13,952
You might not believe this,

191
00:20:13,952 --> 00:20:16,221
but I didn't ask Chen Pin Ming

192
00:20:16,221 --> 00:20:18,656
to plant the bug in your bag.

193
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:24,062
Two years ago,
my father contracted pheromone gland cancer.

194
00:20:24,062 --> 00:20:26,198
I did need the targeted drug intel,

195
00:20:26,198 --> 00:20:28,366
but I'd never put you at risk.

196
00:20:30,936 --> 00:20:33,772
Don't cry, it's my fault.

197
00:20:33,772 --> 00:20:36,307
But I won't let this happen again.

198
00:20:37,943 --> 00:20:41,046
I won't let you get hurt again.

199
00:20:41,046 --> 00:20:43,547
Trust me, okay?

200
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,408
Mr. Sheng...

201
00:21:11,243 --> 00:21:12,843
Yes?

202
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:16,948
Promise you won't fight anyone again.

203
00:21:18,216 --> 00:21:20,284
I'll worry.

204
00:21:21,553 --> 00:21:23,654
Why?

205
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:40,171
Because I like you a lot, too.

206
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,027
Mr. Shen.

207
00:22:05,564 --> 00:22:08,233
Can't you find a decent place to live?

208
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:09,701
What are you doing here?

209
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:11,436
HR gave me your address.

210
00:22:11,436 --> 00:22:13,104
The road's too narrow.

211
00:22:13,104 --> 00:22:14,339
I parked at the intersection.

212
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:15,774
Walked the rest of the way in.

213
00:22:15,774 --> 00:22:18,810
This place isn't for you.

214
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,413
Cut the crap. That's up to me to decide.

215
00:22:21,413 --> 00:22:22,947
Open the door.

216
00:22:32,023 --> 00:22:33,625
Gao Tu.

217
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,993
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

218
00:22:38,363 --> 00:22:40,265
It's not convenient

219
00:22:40,265 --> 00:22:42,200
I've been sick these days,

220
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,435
so I haven't cleaned the room.

221
00:22:43,435 --> 00:22:44,636
The place is a mess, andâ€¦

222
00:22:44,636 --> 00:22:46,438
That Omega lives here too?

223
00:22:46,438 --> 00:22:47,739
What Omega?

224
00:22:47,739 --> 00:22:49,774
The one who goes into heat often.

225
00:22:51,443 --> 00:22:53,411
No, there's no one here.

226
00:22:53,411 --> 00:22:56,380
Then there's nothing wrong with me entering.

227
00:23:10,862 --> 00:23:12,663
Do you live alone?

228
00:23:13,538 --> 00:23:15,272
Yeah.

229
00:23:20,138 --> 00:23:22,407
Am I not paying you enough?

230
00:23:22,407 --> 00:23:25,777
Why live in a dump like this?

231
00:23:25,777 --> 00:23:27,779
The company pays me well.

232
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:30,248
I just have a lot of personal expenses.

233
00:23:30,248 --> 00:23:32,017
If you know money's tight,

234
00:23:32,017 --> 00:23:34,385
then stop paying me back that much every month.

235
00:23:35,286 --> 00:23:36,855
Didn't I tell you?

236
00:23:36,855 --> 00:23:39,057
What I lent you doesn't matter.

237
00:23:39,057 --> 00:23:41,226
- You don't need to pay me back.
- That won't do.

238
00:23:41,226 --> 00:23:43,762
I'm already immensely grateful
that you're covering for me.

239
00:23:43,762 --> 00:23:45,663
Not paying you back wouldn't feel right.

240
00:23:56,441 --> 00:23:58,410
I don't usually have guests over.

241
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:01,046
Is water okay?

242
00:24:01,046 --> 00:24:02,646
Anything's fine.

243
00:24:19,998 --> 00:24:21,866
Take a seat.

244
00:24:21,866 --> 00:24:24,835
What brings you here, sir?

245
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:29,541
Can you stop with the "sir" all the time?

246
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:31,475
This isn't the office.

247
00:24:32,644 --> 00:24:36,348
You aren't even 30 yet. Don't be so stiff.

248
00:24:36,348 --> 00:24:42,286
Okay, but you came all this way
just to tell me I'm stiff?

249
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,625
What happened to your face again?

250
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,762
Don't ask.

251
00:24:50,762 --> 00:24:56,968
That idiot Sheng came after me
this morning in the parking lot.

252
00:24:56,968 --> 00:24:58,670
We got into another fight.

253
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,271
You two aren't middle schoolers.

254
00:25:00,271 --> 00:25:02,006
Why are you always fighting?

255
00:25:02,006 --> 00:25:03,742
I didn't start it.

256
00:25:03,742 --> 00:25:05,877
He picked a fight with me.

257
00:25:05,877 --> 00:25:07,712
Why did he do that?

258
00:25:07,712 --> 00:25:08,979
He...

259
00:25:18,656 --> 00:25:21,092
How's Secretary Hua doing?

260
00:25:21,092 --> 00:25:24,229
Is he back at work?

261
00:25:24,229 --> 00:25:26,998
Why do you care how Hua's doing?

262
00:25:26,998 --> 00:25:29,300
Is he that important to you?

263
00:25:30,835 --> 00:25:34,406
Sorry. You're right, it's none of my business.

264
00:25:34,406 --> 00:25:37,075
Always fussing over an Omega

265
00:25:37,075 --> 00:25:39,778
or meddling in other people's lives.

266
00:25:39,778 --> 00:25:40,979
Worry about yourself first.

267
00:25:40,979 --> 00:25:42,413
Don't make mistakes

268
00:25:42,413 --> 00:25:44,748
like adding an extra zero in the budget again.

269
00:25:47,018 --> 00:25:49,053
You're right.

270
00:25:49,053 --> 00:25:51,389
I'll be more careful.

271
00:25:51,389 --> 00:25:53,425
Anything else?

272
00:25:53,425 --> 00:25:54,626
It's getting late.

273
00:25:54,626 --> 00:25:58,062
If there's nothing else,
maybe you should head back.

274
00:25:59,197 --> 00:26:01,098
You're kicking me out?

275
00:26:03,234 --> 00:26:05,837
This area isn't very safe at night.

276
00:26:05,837 --> 00:26:08,539
It'd be better if you got home earlier.

277
00:26:10,608 --> 00:26:13,244
You think I want to stay in this dump?

278
00:26:13,244 --> 00:26:15,480
The whole place reeks of Omega.

279
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,281
If someone likes it, let them stay.

280
00:26:46,177 --> 00:26:48,279
What are you doing?
Why are you kicking my door?

281
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:50,181
You crazy?

282
00:26:50,181 --> 00:26:52,584
Sorry, I bumped into it.

283
00:26:52,584 --> 00:26:56,254
The hallway light's been out for a while.

284
00:26:56,254 --> 00:26:58,289
So, it's easy to trip.

285
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:00,091
The young man upstairs

286
00:27:00,091 --> 00:27:01,860
came back from working overtime last month.

287
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,228
The corridor had no lights

288
00:27:03,228 --> 00:27:06,064
and he was climbing the stairs,
looking at his phone and sending messages.

289
00:27:06,064 --> 00:27:08,099
He almost fell down.

290
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:10,435
It's very dangerous, so you must be careful.

291
00:27:10,435 --> 00:27:12,202
You got it?

292
00:27:13,438 --> 00:27:14,672
Okay.

293
00:27:14,672 --> 00:27:16,273
Thanks.

294
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,087
Sir, I've fixed all the hallway lights.

295
00:27:29,087 --> 00:27:31,789
Your friend won't fall again coming home.

296
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:33,223
Great.

297
00:27:35,493 --> 00:27:37,395
This place is a dump.

298
00:27:37,395 --> 00:27:39,897
Even the streetlights are dim.

299
00:27:40,698 --> 00:27:43,367
What if he gets hurt coming back at night?

300
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:47,272
Replace all the streetlights
with brighter bulbs.

301
00:27:47,272 --> 00:27:49,007
That's the city's job.

302
00:27:49,007 --> 00:27:50,475
I'll pay you triple.

303
00:27:50,475 --> 00:27:51,843
Just get it done. Now.

304
00:27:51,843 --> 00:27:53,144
No problem.

305
00:27:53,144 --> 00:27:54,745
Go on.

306
00:28:11,763 --> 00:28:13,998
Mr. Sheng, try not to worry too much.

307
00:28:13,998 --> 00:28:17,535
The patient's condition is much better
than when I first saw him.

308
00:28:17,535 --> 00:28:20,838
His recovery speed
has exceeded my expectations.

309
00:28:20,838 --> 00:28:22,439
That's good.

310
00:28:23,141 --> 00:28:26,244
If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave.

311
00:28:26,244 --> 00:28:29,013
Doctor Wang, thanks for making the trip.

312
00:28:29,013 --> 00:28:30,048
You're too kind.

313
00:28:30,048 --> 00:28:32,016
I was just passing by on my way home.

314
00:28:32,016 --> 00:28:34,451
It's my honor to help.

315
00:28:36,387 --> 00:28:38,222
Let me walk him out.

316
00:28:38,222 --> 00:28:39,823
Okay.

317
00:28:46,564 --> 00:28:47,830
Oh, Mr. Sheng.

318
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,468
You mentioned that
during your last rutting period,

319
00:28:50,468 --> 00:28:52,370
you had a pheromone disorder

320
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:55,039
and lost an important client because of it.

321
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,476
Does that still happen?

322
00:28:58,476 --> 00:29:00,211
I haven't lost control recently.

323
00:29:00,211 --> 00:29:01,479
But I've been feeling exhausted,

324
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:04,716
weak all over for no reason.

325
00:29:04,716 --> 00:29:08,185
Your next rut is approaching, right?

326
00:29:08,987 --> 00:29:11,955
Yes, in a few days.

327
00:29:13,024 --> 00:29:18,229
As a high-level Alpha, this should be rare.

328
00:29:18,229 --> 00:29:19,831
If it were an Omega

329
00:29:19,831 --> 00:29:25,836
I'd suspect targeted luring pheromones
from an Alpha causing passive heat.

330
00:29:26,871 --> 00:29:30,174
But as an S-class Alpha, that's unlikely.

331
00:29:30,174 --> 00:29:36,014
Most likely, work stress is causing
transient pheromone disorder.

332
00:29:36,014 --> 00:29:37,782
You're young, Mr. Sheng.

333
00:29:37,782 --> 00:29:38,983
Take care of yourself first.

334
00:29:38,983 --> 00:29:41,352
Your career is a marathon, not a sprint.

335
00:29:41,352 --> 00:29:43,054
Thanks, Doctor Wang. I understand.

336
00:29:43,054 --> 00:29:45,189
Oh, Mr. Sheng, one more thing.

337
00:29:45,189 --> 00:29:48,826
As an S-class Alpha,
the patient is still too weak

338
00:29:48,826 --> 00:29:50,461
to tolerate Alpha scents.

339
00:29:50,461 --> 00:29:53,765
To prevent secondary harm from passive heat,

340
00:29:53,765 --> 00:29:57,754
keep some distance during the rut.

341
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:02,941
I'll prescribe the same Omega
calming pheromone spray as last time.

342
00:30:02,941 --> 00:30:06,277
It should help during your rut.

343
00:30:06,277 --> 00:30:08,346
Thanks.

344
00:30:08,346 --> 00:30:11,783
We've recruited an elite team
from Wall Street's top firms

345
00:30:11,783 --> 00:30:14,018
specifically for this short-selling plan.

346
00:30:14,018 --> 00:30:16,254
HS Group has a concentrated equity structure

347
00:30:16,254 --> 00:30:17,855
with a high proportion of pledged shares.

348
00:30:17,855 --> 00:30:21,759
If the value of Shen Wen Lang's
pledged shares drops drastically,

349
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:26,097
he'll have to inject cash flow
to cover the deficit

350
00:30:26,097 --> 00:30:27,098
to avoid forced liquidation.

351
00:30:27,098 --> 00:30:31,202
Right, this makes it easier
for our bidding team to snatch their projects.

352
00:30:31,202 --> 00:30:34,439
Those projects require
huge capital investments.

353
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:37,241
Shen will be stretched thin

354
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:39,777
trying to cover the market value loss.

355
00:30:39,777 --> 00:30:44,282
Also, our bidding team has completed
preliminary talks with the design institute.

356
00:30:44,282 --> 00:30:48,786
Many standards in the project blueprints
already favor us.

- Yes.

I want their stock price below IPO
within a week.

359
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:58,029
Mr. Sheng, you're being too conservative.

360
00:30:58,029 --> 00:31:00,498
Based on the plan you drafted,

361
00:31:00,498 --> 00:31:02,633
Shen Wen Lang will count himself lucky

362
00:31:02,633 --> 00:31:05,035
if he avoids forced liquidation.

371
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:03,161
Mr. Shen, we lost all three projects
we bid on recently.

372
00:32:03,161 --> 00:32:04,595
Who won them?

373
00:32:04,595 --> 00:32:07,198
- Sheng Fang Biotech.
- Why?

374
00:32:07,198 --> 00:32:09,834
They colluded on bids with ultra low prices,

375
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:11,969
sabotaging our efforts by all means.

376
00:32:11,969 --> 00:32:15,273
Mr. Shen, regulatory authorities
received numerous reports

377
00:32:15,273 --> 00:32:17,809
alleging we manipulated our own stock.

378
00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:21,245
CSRC has launched a task force to investigate.

379
00:32:21,245 --> 00:32:22,647
Mr. Shen, our securities department got a query

380

from the the industry Stock Exchange.

381

Regulators require us
to explain promptly the project losses

00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:30,788
announced in our statement
to stabilize the stock price

and restore investor confidence.

384
00:32:36,594 --> 00:32:38,629
It's just a few projects.

385
00:32:38,629 --> 00:32:42,366
Long-term, they won't
affect company operations.

386
00:32:42,366 --> 00:32:44,068
HS has robust cash flow,

387
00:32:44,068 --> 00:32:46,871
as well as healthy debt-to-equity and profits.

388
00:32:46,871 --> 00:32:51,341
Short-term market fluctuations
are just temporary competition.

389
00:32:52,076 --> 00:32:53,344
Yes.

390
00:32:53,344 --> 00:32:55,046
Secretary Gao summed it up well.

391
00:32:55,046 --> 00:32:59,183
Long-term, our diversified business structure

392
00:32:59,183 --> 00:33:02,253
and broader profit sources

393
00:33:02,253 --> 00:33:04,288
give us stronger risk resistance.

395

has completed formulation,

396
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:14,699

397
00:33:14,699 --> 00:33:17,401

Yes.

Third-party data shows pheromone gland cancer

has a 5/100,000 incidence rate.

The special drug's value is obvious.

402

he had a fever and was delirious.
