00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,060
this ABO social construct

172
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,120
is infinitely close to those of wolves
in some aspects.

[Episode 1]

175
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,409
Most people
are also used to the fact that

176
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:36,280
S-tier Alphas are
the highest of human beings

177
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,580
and are better than others in genes.

178
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,020
But recently, scientists found that

179
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,850
other than the existing
Alpha, Beta, and Omega,

180
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,850
there might be another
unique and rare gender,

181
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:47,920
Enigma.

182
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,590
Though the probability of one becoming
that is less than one in a billion,

183
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,060
it still shocked the whole academic world.

184
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,000
It's been so long.

185
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,530
Why haven't those bioexperts

186
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,130
figured out the evolution ABOs yet?

187
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,540
Experts are mostly unreliable.

188
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,210
That's normal. The expert also said

189
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,410
the peak of human evolution

190
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,940
is not S-tier Alphas

191
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,850
but the niche Enigma.

192
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,880
I heard that Enigmas

193
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,320
can also mark Alphas.

194
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,690
Shaoyou, what does Shengfang Bio,

195
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,820
the head of the business of
biochemical production in Jianghu City,

196
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,990
think about this situation?

197
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,030
Pure nonsense.

198
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,490
Just sensationalism.

199
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,230
Have you ever seen a niche gender

200
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,490
that can mark an Alpha?

201
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,400
Yushan, of course

202
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,200
Shaoyou wouldn't believe this.

203
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,000
He's an S-tier Alpha.

204
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,070
He's born with top pheromones.

205
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,170
He's used to being a king.

206
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,310
Of course he wouldn't believe

207
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,160
this one in a billion

208
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,580
Enigma that greatly surpass S-tier Alphas

209
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,420
the experts speak of.

210
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,320
Yushan.

211
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,790
You changed your perfume?

212
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,490
Yes. My new Omega bought it for me.

213
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,400
This perfume's quite popular these days.

214
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,270
It's not just popular.

215
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,700
This pheromone perfume is
called Drunken Branch.

216
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,010
It's so popular it's difficult to get one.

217
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,780
I heard HS Group

218
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,410
made a lot of money from this.

219
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,180
But...

220
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,750
But what?

221
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,780
It smells

222
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,850
exactly the same as Shaoyou's

223
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,950
own pheromones.

224
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,790
Shaoyou has always been very
conscious about the fact that

225
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,120
his scent has become something cheap
that can be bought.

226
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,790
That's why he hates the boss of HS, Shen Wenlang.

227
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,230
Shaoyou,

228
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,470
is that true?

229
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
I'm sorry.

230
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,470
I didn't know.

231
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:41,930
How could it be?

232
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,000
Don't listen to Li Boqiao's nonsense.

233
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,770
What nonsense?

234
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,640
When Shen Wenlang
invited you for a gathering,

235
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,770
didn't you find excuses to reject him?

236
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,310
Why do you suddenly change your mind?
Don't hate him anymore?

237
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,690
We're friends in business.

238
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,790
How could I hate someone?

239
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,690
I've always found it a pity

240
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,360
for not meeting Mr. Shen at the gathering.

241
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,670
Besides, if I really hate Mr. Shen,

242
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,310
why would I ask you to be the middleman

243
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,740
to ask him out?

244
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,510
I even agreed to meet at HS Group

245
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,580
at his convenience tonight.

246
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,280
What?

247
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,650
Shen Wenlang asked to meet at this hour?

248
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,350
It's so late.

249
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,220
How insincere.

250
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,820
It's your first meeting,

251
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,490
yet it took Wenlang so long to agree.

252
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,890
It's indeed not appropriate.

253
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,930
But his schedules seem
quite packed lately.

254
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,070
He might be busy during the day.

255
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,070
Shaoyou,

256
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,760
don't mind it too much.

257
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,970
HS Group is so successful,

258
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,980
doing well not only in common chemicals,

259
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,410
but also in biology medication.

260
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,120
Shaoyou. That sounds so superficial.

261
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,290
I'm just telling the truth.

262
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,260
HS Group

263
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,090
started making medication for less than
half a year, yet they were

264
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,360
chosen by the biggest
pharmaceutical company X Holdings of

265
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,100
Country P as the only collaborator
for their

266
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,700
pheromone gland cancer medication.

267
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,870
As the top decision-maker of the group,

268
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,070
Mr. Shen must be busy.

269
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,670
Yushan,

270
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,440
thank you.

271
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,840
For setting this up.

272
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,110
We are brothers.

273
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,710
You're welcome.

274
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,760
You two have fun.

275
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,330
A friend of mine is here,

276
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,730
I'm going to go say hello.

277
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,930
Okay, you go ahead.

278
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,670
Shaoyou. Did Yushan tell you?

279
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,870
What?

280
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,370
Shen Wenlang hates Omegas the most.

281
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,370
Don't bring an Omega with you

282
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,300
when you're going to meet
him for the collaboration.

283
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,910
Don't worry. You're well-informed.

284
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,980
I'll only take you with me.

285
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,020
No.

286
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,480
Not me.

287
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,620
I only know how to flirt with girls.

288
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,890
I feel sleepy when I hear you

289
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,490
talk business.

290
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,220
Oh, right, Shaoyou.

291
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,260
Did you ask Shen Wenlang to meet

292
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,190
because of your father's illness?

293
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,460
With the authorization of X Holdings,

294
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,270
HS Group has become the company that is

295
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,270
most likely able to find a cure

296
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,330
for pheromone gland cancer in China.

297
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,040
That's why you agreed

298
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,570
to meet Shen Wenlang
despite the late timing.

299
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,780
Mr. Sheng.

300
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,010
Director Wang, how is my dad?

301
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,420
He's still in a coma.

302
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,180
But he's out of danger.

303
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,720
The condition is not very optimistic.

304
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,790
Although the cancer cells haven't spread yet,

305
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,090
but the location of the tumor is special.

306
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,830
If we remove the tumor,
it would damage the gland.

307
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,090
For Alphas,

308
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,100
the survival rate of
a gland damage is zero.

309
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,000
So we dare not operate rashly.

310
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,270
It's the best result we can achieve

311
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,800
by maintaining this situation given
we don't have medication.

312
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:10,080
Is your father getting worse?

313
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,650
Although it's an indolent cancer

314
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,950
and doesn't spread easily,

315
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,480
thinking about it,

316
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,140
your father has been sick
for two to three years.

317
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,190
Could it be...

318
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,260
Nonsense.

319
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,890
My dad is still the same.

320
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,530
That's good.

321
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,900
It's almost time.

322
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,870
I'm leaving.

323
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,400
Help me tell Yushan.

324
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,010
Leaving so soon?

325
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,050
I heard that New Money Shen
is very narrow-minded.

326
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,050
He'd get back at people
who are late.

327
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,580
You do hate him.

00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,450
You're welcome.

339
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,560
Mr. Shen just finished his meeting.

340
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,630
Please come in.

341
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,930
All the lights are still on
at this hour.

342
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,200
Your company deserve its reputation.

343
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,870
Mr. Shen always leads by example.

344
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,540
Of course his subordinates
dare not slack off.

345
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,540
Please come in.

346
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,060
Mr. Sheng is here.

347
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,460
Come in.

348
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,160
Welcome.

349
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,770
Why are you here?

350
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,270
I'm sorry.

351

[HS Group]

352
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,560
This is my new secretary, Hua Yong.

353
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,170
What?

354
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,990
Mr. Shaoyou, you know him?

355
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,440
Yes.

356
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,040
I've always wanted to know Mr. Wenlang.

357
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,609
If I knew he is your secretary,

358
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,680
I would've asked him for your contact

359
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,950
instead of asking Yushan for help.

360
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
Hua Yong, you're really something.

361
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,090
You know our famous Mr. You.

362
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,920
If you had written on your resume

363
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,490
that you know Shengfang Bio's Mr. Shaoyou,

364
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,960
HS Group wouldn't make you

365
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,820
just a mere assistant secretary.

366
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,300
M-Mr. Shen.

367
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,360
Shengfang Bio is a competitor

368
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,740
according to our contract.

369
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,540
If anyone knows people from Shengfang Bio,

370
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,810
they must report in advance before
starting their jobs.

371
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,710
I really don't know Mr. Sheng.

372
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,380
I didn't mean to hide it.

373
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,510
Yes, we don't really know each other.

374
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,010
We just met at Heci Hospital once.

375
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,680
Secretary Hua didn't notice
and bumped into me in the lobby.

376
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,960
It was you.

377
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,650
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you earlier.

378
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,160
I'm sorry about that day.

379
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,930
I went to the hospital to visit my sister

380
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,830
and bumped into Mr. Sheng.

381
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,300
I'm really sorry about that day.

382
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,510
What's the use of saying sorry?

383
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,080
Go.

384
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,360
[HS Group]

385
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,710
Apologize to Mr. Shaoyou properly.

386
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,030
No need.

387
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:53,790
It's not a big deal.

388
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,750
[Hua Yong]

389
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,400
Mr. Sheng, my name is Hua Yong.

390
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,900
I'm really sorry about that day.

391
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:05,940
No need.

392
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,380
Secretary Hua, I'll keep the business card for Mr. Sheng.

393

[Hua Yong]

[HS Group]

395
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,920
Secretary Chen.

396
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,560
Mr. Shen and Mr. Sheng
are friends at first sight.

397
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,890
I believe they have many things
to talk about.

398
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,560
How about this?

399
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,560
Let Secretary Hua and I

400
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,360
take you to the lounge next door.

401
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,490
Let's have tea while waiting for them.

402
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,590
Mr. Sheng, I'll wait for you outside.

403
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,640
Please, Secretary Hua.

404
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,050
Mr. Wenlang really thinks highly of us.

405
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,690
Putting us in your list of competitors.

406
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,030
Of course.

407
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,930
Shengfang Bio dominates the industry
in Jianghu in terms of scale.

408
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,940
Of course you're an important competitor.

409
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,170
Those talks about scale

410
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,830
is just what outsiders think.

411
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,140
In my opinion,

412
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,910
HS's business structure is healthier.

413
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,950
From common chemicals
to targeted medicine research,

414
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,350
HS is diversifying very quickly.

415
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,810
The winner takes them all.

416
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,980
Are you trying to say that I'm
but a jack of all trades?

417
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,520
Not at all.

418
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,600
Compared to the Shengang Bio,

419
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,470
HS entered the biomed industry a little later.

420
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,340
As the saying goes,

421
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,770
"To stand on the shoulders of giants."

422
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,910
Unlike you, who does everything with
pure skills,

423
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,740
we are just lucky.

424
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,250
To have gotten the
exclusive information on

425
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,310
pheromone gland cancer medication
research results

426
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,520
from X Holdings.

427
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,050
You're too modest.

428
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,890
In the whole world,

429
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,310
X Holdings is also a super
domineering in the industry.

430
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,130
Twenty years ago,

431
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,210
80% of Country P's

432
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,230
main grain transaction was by them.

433
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,930
After the pandemic,

434
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,680
they developed

435
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,200
the global patent for
pheromone inhibitor.

436
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,810
The annual income of X Holdings last year

437
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,660
was 30%

438
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,640
of Country P's GDP.

439
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,480
One could say they're
a monster in the industry,

440
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,310
and a super powerful
organization of Country P.

441
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,720
To be able to stand on the shoulders

442
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,490
of such shoulders,

443
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,750
Mr. Wenlang, you are no ordinary person.

444
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,760
You flatter me.

445
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,850
Mr. Shaoyou,

446
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:44,310
are you using our
popular pheromone perfume, Drunken Branch?

447
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm so forgetful.

448
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,300
You're an S-tier Alpha.

449
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,610
Why would you use our
pheromone perfume?

450
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,410
I've heard of it.

451
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,310
Your own pheromones smell

452
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,310
very similar to our Drunken Branch.

453
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,180
This means I'm fated with HS.

454
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,480
Yes.

455
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,880
If there's no fate,

456
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,920
why would we sit together and chat?

457
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,860
Since it's fate,

458
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,390
I'll cut to the chase

459
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,990
and stop going in circles.

460
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,330
Shengfang Bio,

461
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,560
as the first research institute to

462
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,620
research on pheromone gland cancer,

463
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,300
is very interested in the
targeted drug research

464
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,470
HS has.

465
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,610
Shengfang is willing

466
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,940
to purchase 60% of HS's shares.

467
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,880
The premise is that you have to share the

468
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,640
-research results of the targeted drug–
-Mr. You.

469
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,510
The current society is very impatient.

470
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,250
Many people call themselves entrepreneurs,

471
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,420
yet they manage companies like they're
raising pigs,

472
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,650
fattening them up to sell them everywhere,

473
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,310
thinking of only cashing out.

474
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,960
But I founded HS singlehandedly.

475
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,460
I'm raising it like my own son.

476
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,100
I love it deeply.

477
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,000
I never thought of

478
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,500
selling shares or our core technology–

479
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,470
Three billion.

480
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:55,670
Mr. Wenlang,

481
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,030
I'm a straightforward person.

482
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,310
No one will betray their son
just for a lot of money.

483
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,710
3.5 billion.

484
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,510
Many people don't sell their sons

485
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,410
not because they don't want to sell them,

486
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,580
but because the buyer
is not sincere enough

487
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,380
and the price is not high enough.

488
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,120
Mr. Shaoyou is really sincere.

489
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,260
Thank you for your appreciation.

490
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,460
Unfortunately, I'm not short of money.

491
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,430
I'm afraid I'll have to let you down.

492
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,170
Even 35 billion can't convince you.

493
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,600
It seems the rumor is right.

494
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,930
Your family background
is really unfathomable.

495
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,870
But it can never be compared to

496
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,480
how rich and generous Shengfang Bio is.

497
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,280
3.5 billion without batting an eyelid.

498
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,750
How generous.

499
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,550
Of course it's because
HS Group is worth it.

500
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,160
To be honest,

501
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,690
I'm determined to get

502
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,730
the targeted drug's research outcomes.

503
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,800
A gentleman helps others
with their wishes.

504
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,470
Since Mr. Wenlang doesn't want to
give up the shares,

505
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,230
please consider selling
the targeted drug project.

506
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,700
We are willing to continue
investing with you

507
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,230
to speed up the clinical trial
of the medicine

508
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,380
so that the targeted drug can be
sold in the market as soon as possible

509
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,040
and benefit more patients.

510
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,980
Mr. Shen,

511
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,180
I want to make friends with you.

512
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,910
But that depends on how highly you think
of us Shengfang.

513
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,720
Damn it. He is so persistent.

514
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,460
When I get the core technology
of the targeted drug,

515
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,860
let alone 3.5 billion,

516
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,190
I wouldn't give you even 350 bucks.

517
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,570
I do feel a connection between us.

518
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,770
I'm sure we can be good friends.

519
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,470
However, let's just forget

520
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,800
about the collaboration.

521
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,580
Why?

522
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,880
Do you HS look down on us Shengfang?

523
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:47,650
Of course not.

524
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,420
It's just the patent of targeted medicine

525
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,780
is our core asset.

526
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,210
Even brothers would
separate their assets.

527
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,750
Although I want to make less friends with you,

528
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,090
I can't sell our core technology

529
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,030
just for this.

530
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,960
I understand what you mean.

531
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,870
It seems the fate

532
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,530
between Shengfang and HS is
not quite there yet.

533
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,430
We need to build it up more.

534
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,440
In that case,

535
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,630
I won't bother you.

536
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,540
Mr. Wenlang, let's talk another day.

537
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,880
I'll find a way to pay for the surgery.

538
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,560
Okay, thank you for your understanding.

539
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,740
Mr. Sheng...

540
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,670
He's so petty.

541
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:15,940
How cute.

542
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:27,850
Secretary Hua.

543
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,180
You're still here?

544
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,420
I was just taking a call.

545
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,050
Are you getting off work?

546
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,560
Secretary Hua, where do you live?

547
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,300
Don't think too much.

548
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,500
You may not know, but

549
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,970
a full-time employee who
gets off work after 9 p.m.

550
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,030
will get their taxi fare reimbursed.

551
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:54,810
Secretary Hua, you're still
on your probation period, right?

552
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:57,740
If it's on the way, I can send you
home by cab first.

No. 12, Xingren Lane.

554
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,310
Thank you, Secretary Gao.

555
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,530
I'm sorry,

556
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,440
but I happened to overhear in the lobby,

557
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,370
that...

558
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,070
Secretary Hua, you have family
hospitalized in Heci?

559
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,170
Heci is a well established
hospital in Jianghu.

560
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,980
Though the building is a little old,

561
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,520
they have the best
medical funds and equipments in Jianghu.

562
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,650
It's just, they're a little expensive.

563
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,720
They are.

564
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,560
I have a sister who is also
in Heci hospital.

565
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,990
It's been many years.

566
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,850
We've been waiting for a surgery.

567
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,060
So,

568
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,900
I understand how you feel.

569

[Shen Wenlang]

570
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,250
Okay, I got it.

571
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:16,690
You said you didn't like Omegas.

572
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:24,930
Secretary Gao.

573
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,270
Are you a Beta?

574
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,240
I heard from HR that

575
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,170
Mr. Shen and you were high school classmates.

576
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,470
You've been working
with Mr. Shen for many years.

577
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,710
It must be hard working with Mr. Shen.

578
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,120
Not at all.

579
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:45,350
Mr. Shen is actually a good boss.

580
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,190
Although he has high
requirements for work,

581
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:51,260
he never gives his
subordinates a hard time.

582
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,730
Since middle school,

583
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,860
Mr. Shen rarely came into contact
with any other Omegas.

584
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,160
Speaking of which,

585
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,320
you're the first Omega

586

working with Mr. Shen.

587
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,700
I've heard about it
since my first day of work.

588
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,470
That Mr. Shen hates Omegas.

589
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:09,180
Did Mr. Shen tell you that?

590
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,080
No.

591
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,780
Secretary General Qin said it.

592
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,890
I see.

593
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,760

Can you go to a nearby
convenience store?

602
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,470
I need to buy something.

603
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,440

[Spray inhibitor] [Painkiller]

611
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,540
Sir, inhibitors can only

612
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,940
be used during heats.

613
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:26,510
If you use it long term, it will cause

614
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,280
pheromone disorder and severe headaches.

615
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,980
If it's serious, it might cause shock

616

and endanger your life.

In addition,

you can't use painkillers
and inhibitors at the same time.

Thank you.

620

But I'm a Beta.

621
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,330

Okay.

In compliance with
the drug control measures,

This is a spray inhibitor.

Just one spray can help
inhibit pheromones.

But the most common ones

630

are patches.

671
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,540
And our daughter is an Alpha

672
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:47,010
that's always sick.

673
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,510
Just you wait.

674
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:49,910
I'll come again.

675
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,710
Make sure you have money by then!

676
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,350
Mom, I've differentiated.

677
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,180
I'm not a Beta–

678
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,950
Shh...

679
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:58,950
Shh...

680
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,890
Little rabbit, you are a Beta.

681
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,560
You're a Beta with asthma.

682
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:06,030
You've just became an Omega,

683
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,130
yet I'm leaving.

684
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,390
There are many things
I can't tell you one by one.

685
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,400
But you must remember one thing.

686
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,540
Don't let anyone

687
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,760
know you're an OMega.

688
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,000
This is an inhibitor inhaler.

689
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,670
I've taken off it's label.

690
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,010
If anyone asks you,

691
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,270
just say it's asthma.

692
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,680
You must use it long term.

693
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,480
Don't let anyone smell

694
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,780
your pheromones.

695
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,910
Do you understand?

696
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:28,920
You have to promise me.

697
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,250
Understand?

698
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,650
Say yes.

699
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,750
Do you understand?

700
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,420
Mom, I understand.

701
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,320
I won't tell anyone.

702
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,190
Mom, don't cry.

703
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,900
Remember, you're a Beta.

704
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,700
You're a Beta.

705
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:17,530
Hello?

706
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,430
Secretary Gao.

707
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,230
You finally picked up.

708
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,360
Secretary General.

709
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,540
Is there anything urgent?

710
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,270
Sorry to bother you when you're resting.

711
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,670
But it's urgent.

712
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:30,240
I gave you a encrypted
hard disk last weekend.

713
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,170
Do you remember?

714
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,380
It's with me.

715
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,780
The information and data report
for this Monday's meeting

716
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,050
are all in this hard disk.

717
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,820
Secretary Hua is in charge of

718
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,150
the Monday regular meeting.

719
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,760
Should I ask Secretary Hua to pick it up

720
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,730
or could you pass it to him?

721
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,830
-The whole house reeks of pheromones now.
-Hello?

722
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,630
-I can't let anyone come.
-Secretary Gao, are you listening?

723
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,260
I-I'll deliver it to him.

724
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,170
Thank you so much.

725
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,500
This means so much to me.

726
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,800
But...

727
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,530
is it okay to leave your Omega

728
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,110
home alone

729
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,410
in their heat?

730
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,650
It should be fine if it's just
for a short time.

731
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,350
Okay, thank you so much.

732
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,200
My fever has gone down.

733
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,430
My heat should be over.

734
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,130
It should be fine to
deliver it to him, right?

735
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:59,630
Mr. Gao, your long-term abuse
of pheromone inhibitors

736
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,400
has caused great damage to your
pheromone gland.

737
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,740
Based on your current situation,

738
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:08,240
you can't use any inhibitor
for the time being,

739
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,240
especially injected ones.

740
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,910
Your heat is coming.

741
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,480
Your glands are worn down.

742
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,920
I suggest you stay

743
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:17,930
[Pheromone clinic]

744
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,180
in the hospital for this heat cycle.

745
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,990
Doctor, I can't stay in the hospital.

746
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,790
You should at least take a leave and rest.

747
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,320
Doctor.

748
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,160
What should I do if I don't want

749
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,530
my pheromones leak?

750
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,000
Other than my sister,

751
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,700
no one knows I'm an Omega.

752
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,500
I can't use inhibitor patches.

753
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,500
Mr. Gao.

754
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,510
You've been here

755
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,570
for years.

756
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,180
With all due respect,

757
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,050
you should see a psychiatrist.

758
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,670
You refuse to acknowledge

759
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,090
your identity as an Omega

760
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,320
and are even very self-abased.

761
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,420
Is it because of your partner?

762
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,320
Does he not like your scent or...

763
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,460
Sorry.

764
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,030
This is mainly my guess.

765
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,900
After all, the amount of inhibitors

766
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,570
you've used is too high.

767
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:09,730
Using huge amounts of inhibitor inhalers
every day

768
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,200
is a huge burden to your body.

769
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:14,240
At the same time, I want to remind you,

770
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,210
if my guess is true,

771
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:18,980
your other half is suspected of abuse.

772
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,450
According to the
ABO Equal Rights Agreement–

773
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:24,150
No.

774
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,210
It's not like that.

775
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,190
Doctor, I'm single.

776
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,760
That's even worse.

777
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,320
It's very dangerous for a single Omega

778
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,930
who is not pregnant to use

779
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,290
inhibitors this much.

780
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,820
This will cause pheromone disorders.

781
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:39,230
It'll even endanger your life.

782
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,730
Besides, using injections during heats

783
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,460
is already a toll for your body.

784
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,540
Don't you feel pain?

785
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,940
I take painkillers.

786
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,810
Nonsense!

787
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:52,510
Ignoring what the doctors tell you and
taking inhibitors is one thing,

788
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,980
but you're taking painkillers while using

789
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,980
injected inhibitors during your heat?

790
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,020
Do you want to die?

791
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,960
It's just passing a document.

792
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,810
It's not like I'm going to be
in contact with people for a long time.

793
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:25,010
I'm sure I can cover my pheromones
by taking an inhibitor.

794
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:49,870
Secretary Gao.

795
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:53,310
I live in Room 106, Unit 2, Building 1, No. 12, Xingren Lane.

796
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,980
Please send it over. Thank you.

797
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:37,580
[Room 106, Unit 2, Building 1, No. 12, Xingren Lane]

798
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,490
I'm sweating so much.

799
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:46,090
Hopefully I don't smell.

800
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,160
I should've used an injected inhibitor.

801
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,800
Secretary Hua.

802
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,070
It's me.

803
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,650
Secretary Gao.
