I told you to stay out of it.

Khem's a good guy.

Grand Master,

15
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,360
is he gonna die?

I think it looks great,

a bit more blending here.

Stop it.

- Okay.
- It's okay.

That was such an in-depth comment.

Should I be expecting
a grade, Professor?

164

What about eighth grade?

Aren't we talking about an A, B, or C?

especially in the woman.

173
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,120
She looks really kind.

174
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,280
I used my mom's photo as a reference.

175
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,080
If she sees this,

176
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,570
she'll be really proud.

177
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,800
You're...

178
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,560
no longer with your mom, right?

179
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,640
Please forgive me for being rude.

180
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,840
I'm sorry for your loss.

181
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,720
Charn, look up!

182
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,720
You're overdoing it, too.

183
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,440
Forgive us, Khem.

184
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,280
This camp is full of weirdos.

185
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
It's okay.

186
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,520
Actually,

187
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,560
it's been a long time since she passed.

188
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
I'm Charnvit,

189
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,200
a third-year psychology student.

190
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,200
This is my first volunteer camp.

191
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,200
Nice to meet you, Khem.

192
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,960
Whoa...

193
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,320
Why so formal?

194
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,920
Well,

195
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,480
nice to meet you, too!

196
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,720
Prae, are you done?

197
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,200
Wow.

198
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,280
This looks gorgeous, babe.

199
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,200
I didn't do this alone.

200
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,640
This is all from the hands
of a legend, Khemjira.

201
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,600
Khemjira?

202
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,120
Right!

203
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,400
That's him,

204
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,440
the guy with a girl's name.

205
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,320
- I see.
- Yeah.

206
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,280
Honestly, I'd totally believe
he's a tomboy.

207
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,960
- He's gorgeous.
- You're right, dude.

208
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,680
In this day and age,

209
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,680
isn't it inappropriate

210
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,760
to judge people by how they look

211
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,480
and joke about their gender identity?

212
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,740
Why so serious, dude?

213
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,920
We just meant to say he's cute.

214
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,400
Just take it as a compliment, man.

215
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,080
Let us know if you need anything.

216
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,560
Hey, what are you doing?

217
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,320
Get your hands off Khem now.

218
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,320
Stay right there.

219
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,800
I'll take care of every one of you.

220
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,480
What the fuck?

221
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,680
Is Khem a monk or something?

222
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,240
Why can't we touch him?

223
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,600
Well...

224
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,640
If you're done with your work,

225
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,360
how about giving them a hand?

226
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,680
They want you there.

227
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,200
Come on.

228
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,320
Just go.

229
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,560
Now, alright?

230
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,480
- What the hell?
- Go!

231
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,320
Let's go.

232
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,340
Did they hurt you?

233
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,560
Jeez, acting like total thugs...

234
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,680
They're just a bunch of jerks.

235
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,320
Look who's talking.

236
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,760
They were just being friendly.

237
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,040
New friends are fine, right?

238
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,760
Who's this guy?

239
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,060
A new friend, too?

240
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,080
I'm right here.

241
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,480
Why don't you just ask me?

242
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,840
Actually,

243
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,680
when you want to get to know someone,

244
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,320
shouldn't you introduce yourself first?

245
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,080
What? You're getting on my nerves.

246
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,800
- Hey...
- Who said I wanna know you?

247
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,440
Come on.

248
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,280
What's wrong with you guys?

249
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,920
This is Charn,

250
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,720
also a junior.

251
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,620
He's a psychology student.

252
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,680
This is Jet,

253
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,240
my best friend.

254
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,100
Since we're all here together,

255
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,960
it wouldn't hurt to be friends,

256
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,560
right?

257
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,000
It's indeed full of weirdos.

258
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,720
- Here we go.
- Alright.

259
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,770
- Sod Chaeng!
- Sod Chaeng!

260
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,240
Coconut rum,
Ubon Ratchathani's local gem!

261
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,680
You can't get it in Bangkok, you know!

262
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,200
Exactly, Worn.

263
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,560
Smells so nice.

264
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,800
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

265
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,080
It's not often I get to drink
with the young ones.

266
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,440
I'm enjoying this.

267
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,680
- Yeah.
- Right.

268
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,360
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

269
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Some snacks.

270
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,080
- Here.
- Thanks.

271
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,520
Rae!

272
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,040
- Yes?
- Rae!

273
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,720
- Yes?
- Bring us more snacks.

274
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,680
- Okay.
- These are almost gone.

275
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,680
Here you go.

276
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,110
This is also a local gem.

277
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,110
- Wow.
- My wife made it.

278
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,400
We're probably gonna drink
this Sod Chaeng till dawn.

279
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,960
Rae, you can head to bed first.
We don't mind.

280
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,880
Come on,

281
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,840
she always stays up late.

282
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,120
Let her be here

283
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,920
in case we want something.

284
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,680
Yeah, I usually stay up late.

285
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,120
If you need anything, just tell me.

286
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,240
I'll get it for you.

287
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,160
But...

288
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,040
don't drink too much, okay?

289
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,480
I heard you have
an early start tomorrow, right?

290
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,080
Hey, Worn,

291
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,720
cheers.

292
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,920
- Oh, cheers!
- Come on.

293
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,120
- Sod Chaeng!
- Sod Chaeng!

294
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,100
Guys.

295
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,800
Hey.

296
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,640
Why don't you go upstairs?

297
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,440
Argh!

298
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,360
Please stop.

299
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,720
What the hell do you do for me each day?

300
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,880
I'm working hard to make money for you,

301
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,080
and you have the nerve
to boss me around?

302
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,040
That's not what I did.

303
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,040
I was just telling you

304
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,100
- 'cause you might have to work early.
- Shut your mouth.

305
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,080
- Should I just kill you now?
- Argh!

306
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,160
Worn...

307
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,800
- Should I?
- Please...

308
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,280
Kill? Seriously?

309
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,480
You sure it wasn't a dream?

310
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,080
A dream, my ass.

311
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,040
He was totally losing it,
like he was possessed.

312
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,640
He kept beating his wife badly.

313
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,240
Beating his wife?

314
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,560
Which Worn are you talking about?

315
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,760
The one who brought us the tools?

316
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,240
No way. It's not him.

317
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,680
He's a good guy.

318
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,310
He's also nice, actually.

319
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,280
Yeah.

320
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,640
He was breaking up a dogfight
at the temple the other day,

321
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,040
and he wouldn't even dare to hit them.

322
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,480
He was completely normal
to his wife this morning.

323
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,920
You're making things up, bro.

324
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,880
Right.

325
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,560
No one believes me at all.

326
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,440
Who would actually fight
in front of their guests?

327
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,600
If you're sure about it,
you should tell the locals here.

328
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,960
You're staying at their place.

329
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,040
If something goes wrong,
you'll be in trouble.

330
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,280
And domestic violence...

331
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,400
isn't something to be ignored.

332
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,680
Exactly.

333
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,400
And it's none of your business.

334
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,920
- Hey!
- Hey!

335
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,760
Stop it!

336
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,960
Stay here.

337
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Sit down.

338
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,040
Eat your food.

339
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,360
Just eat it.

340
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,240
Sorry.

341
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,760
What were you tryna do?

342
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,760
Why would you get involved?

343
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,840
Don't forget the reason you're here.

344
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,679
I know,

345
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,400
but I don't know what to do.

346
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,600
I haven't even had a chance
to talk to Master yet.

347
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,600
Come on,

348
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,000
nothing about it is hard.

349
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,639
Your food, Master.

350
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,840
Well... Uh...

351
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,560
I just wanted to thank you...

352
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,720
for replacing my necklace cord
the other day.

353
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,600
Please give it a try.

354
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,240
If you don't like it,

355
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,240
I'll adjust the seasoning for you.

356
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,360
How is it, Master?

357
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,440
Fantastic, right?

358
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,640
It's alright.

359
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,840
Don't bother adding more stuff to it.

360
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,560
And if you keep staring at me like that,

361
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,880
I don't think I have any appetite.

362
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,480
Go change your shirt.

363
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,840
Okay.

364
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,680
He ate it all.

365
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,960
Thought he said
it was just alright, huh?

366
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
Master!

367
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,760
Leave that to me.

368
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,240
I'll clear the table.

369
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,840
Alright.

370
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,880
Please get it done.

371
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,000
Uh...

372
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,920
Master,

373
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,120
may I have a moment with you?

374
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,520
You have that much free time?

375
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,720
Is there nothing to do at the camp?

376
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,520
I mean...

377
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,560
Since Grand Master Sek saved me before,

378
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,720
he might have left some way
to break my curse.

379
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,080
Do you...

380
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,800
happen to know anything about it?

381
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,120
It was him who warned me

382
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,120
to stay away from people's karma.

383
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,920
I've said enough. Hope you understand.

384
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,120
Please help me.

385
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,120
Please.

386
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,300
I'm begging you.

387
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,320
Don't do this.

388
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,440
I can't help you.

389
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,240
Do you want me to break my promise
to my grandfather for you?

390
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,040
I know it might sound selfish,

391
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,560
but I don't think...

392
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,160
you can stand
seeing people suffer, right?

393
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,880
[Phra Nakhon, 1939]

394
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,840
Mister...

395
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,720
Sir!

396
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Mister,

397
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,280
I'm up here!

398
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,320
Can you please get me a ladder?

399
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,690
I mean...

400
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,480
I can't get back down.

401
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,920
Uh...

402
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,200
Say thanks to him.

403
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,360
Aw.

404
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,240
You're sleeping, huh?

405
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,040
Is this your cat?

406
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,640
No, it's not.

407
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,260
I don't know where it came from,

408
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,960
but it was stuck up there.

409
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,960
So you went up to help the cat

410
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,280
and ended up stuck there yourself?

411
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,680
The way it cried just broke my heart.

412
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,240
All I thought about was saving it.
I didn't even think about myself.

413
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,440
You also wanted to help me.

414
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,960
You looked totally shocked

415
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,120
when you saw me up there.

416
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,520
Thank you.

417
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,120
You're...

418
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,880
Pawat.

419
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,840
I'm Pawat Wongpradit.

420
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,040
Pawat Wongpradit...

421
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,280
That's a beautiful name.

422
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,830
Oh,

423
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,160
I'm Khem,

424
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,520
Khemmika.

425
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,240
I've fixed all the windows now, Master.

426
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,360
Thanks a lot.

427
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,040
So...

428
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,600
I'll see you later.

429
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,720
Goodbye.

430
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,400
He was totally losing it,
like he was possessed.

431
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,360
He kept beating his wife badly.

432
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,760
Look.

433
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,800
- About what you asked...
- Master...

434
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,800
Is it possible...

435
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,480
that...

436
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,160
Worn might be possessed?

437
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,840
You saw the energy, didn't you?

438
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,200
My guess is he went into the forest
to fetch something

439
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,560
and passed through those spirits.

440
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,280
Living with nature and spirits
is just the way things are here.

441
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,160
It's nothing unusual.

442
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,200
Still got some booze?
I'll have some tonight.

443
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,720
You drank it all, though...

444
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,640
Worn!

445
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:38,960
Worn.

446
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,080
- Hello.
- Hi.

447
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,280
- You forgot this.
- Oh, thanks.

448
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,520
So many of you came.

449
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,320
Did Te invite you over for drinks?

450
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,640
Oh...

451
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,440
We don't drink.

452
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,600
But Te and the others
always talk about Rae's fermented pork.

453
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,480
We were wondering
if we could try a little.

454
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:03,880
Right?

455
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,000
- That's right.
- Yes.

456
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,320
- Yeah.
- Right.

457
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,880
Rae, still got some fermented pork?

458
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Yes.

459
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,640
Come on, join me.

460
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,480
Let's eat.

461
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:18,840
Okay.

462
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,920
Why would you be here, too?

463
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,280
Khem asked me to come.

464
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,640
You didn't need to know.

465
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,000
This one is ready. It's already sour.

466
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,800
Just put it in the fridge,
and it's good to go.

467
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,920
- Thank you.
- The other two still need time.

468
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,880
Leave them out for now,
and put them in the fridge tomorrow.

469
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,880
Whoa, this is way too much, Rae.

470
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,260
- I feel bad taking so much.
- Don't worry about it.

471
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,200
I always make extra. Worn loves it.

472
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,200
Go ahead and share it with everyone.

473
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,120
Rae,

474
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,960
what happened to you?

475
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,080
Uh...

476
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,760
I fell.

477
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,460
That's all. I'm alright.

478
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,080
Stay out of this, Khem.

479
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,920
Rae might've actually fallen over.

480
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,960
It was so obvious
a toddler could see right through it.

481
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,840
I know!

482
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,520
I'm not that stupid.

483
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,080
Even if Worn actually hurt his wife,

484
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,200
it's none of our business, right?

485
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,200
What if he's actually possessed?

486
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,240
Possessed?

487
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,440
By what?

488
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,160
A party spirit, perhaps?

489
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,200
You, too, Khem.

490
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,680
Don't say such things.

491
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,400
Uh...

492
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,150
We've arrived at the Master's house.

493
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:10,760
By the way,
why are you following us, Chan?

494
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,000
Aren't you supposed to be
on your way back to Auntie Kaew's?

495
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,820
It's way over there, on the same route.

496
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,640
Both of us have to go now.

497
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,480
See you, okay?

498
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,120
Let's go, Jet.

499
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,800
We need to go now.

500
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,760
Quickly.

501
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,640
Hey, Worn.

502
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,440
Take it easy.

503
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,340
Are you starving or something?

504
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:53,760
Come on,

505
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,280
it's once in a while, man.

506
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,900
Once in a while?

507
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,800
You literally drink every day.

508
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,280
What is it?

509
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,160
Look,

510
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,920
be honest with me.

511
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:10,820
You worried about something?

512
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:16,730
Got some problems?

513
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,720
Someone like me?

514
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,440
There's no way I'd have any problems.

515
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,600
How's it going

516
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,680
with your wife, Rae?

517
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,240
We're fine.

518
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,970
What problems could there be?

519
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,030
No problems at all?

520
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:00,870
No.

521
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:08,900
Married couples

522
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,120
do fight, you know.

523
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,480
Kaew and I argue all the time,

524
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,680
but we never get physical.

525
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,480
Hey...

526
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,800
I'm not the kind of guy

527
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,520
who'd lay a hand on Rae.

528
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,040
Jeez.

529
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:33,960
Who's that?

530
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,160
Hey!

531
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,040
That boy,

532
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,530
come here.

533
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:57,960
Well... I...

534
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,480
Auntie Kaew asked me to come.

535
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,240
You know, she's Uncle Chai's wife.

536
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,440
She's really kind and...

537
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,040
I get it.

538
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,280
I'll be there.

539
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,560
Thanks a lot.

540
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:15,580
Okay.

541
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,360
Want some drinks?

542
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,640
Did my wife tell you
to tell Chai about this?

543
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,320
What do you mean?

544
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,200
I don't...

545
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,160
I have no idea.

546
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,400
Did my wife tell you I beat her?

547
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,400
Hey, Worn!

548
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,440
Take it easy.

549
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,480
Why take it out on him?

550
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,520
He has no idea.

551
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:45,880
Just finish your drink.

552
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,280
You called me here

553
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,840
'cause you chose to take her side?

554
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,360
Hey, wait.

555
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,720
Wait, Worn!

556
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,560
Jeez, you son of a bitch.

557
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,760
What?

558
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,560
Seriously?

559
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,400
So...

560
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,360
how is Worn now?

561
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:12,800
Okay.

562
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,680
It's damn late. Where are you going?

563
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,680
Charn called.

564
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,520
He told Uncle Chai about Worn,

565
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,760
so Uncle Chai warned him.

566
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,880
And now he's mad,
thinking Rae told Uncle Chai about him.

567
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,160
Right now,

568
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,720
he's heading home, totally drunk.

569
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,880
I'm afraid...

570
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,400
that Rae might get hurt.

571
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,680
Shit!

572
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,320
When did you...

573
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,260
give Charn your number?

574
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,320
Gosh.

575
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,240
That's the only thing you picked up?

576
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,200
It's not the point at all.

577
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,040
Fine, my bad.

578
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,400
I told you
to stay out of their business.

579
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,680
But if you're going,

580
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,280
I'm coming with you.

581
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,480
Rae!

582
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,240
Rae, where are you?

583
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,760
Worn?

584
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,800
You're drinking again?

585
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,240
Leave me alone.

586
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,400
You should stop.

587
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,760
Let go.

588
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,600
- Please, Worn.
- Go away.

589
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,760
Kill them...

590
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,840
Do it.

591
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,040
You bitch.

592
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,440
You talk too much.

593
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,960
I'll make sure you can't tell anyone
a damn thing anymore.

594
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,280
- Worn...
- You bitch.

595
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,680
Please don't do it.

596
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:38,980
Stop it, Worn.

597
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,000
Let go of me!

598
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,440
- Leave me alone.
- Are you alright, Rae?

599
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,760
- Don't mess with me.
- You're safe now.

600
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:44,960
Let go of me.

601
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,190
- What are you doing?
- Go away.

602
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,100
Have you gone nuts?

603
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,800
Stay out of our fucking business.

604
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,080
Kill them...

605
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,400
Kill them all.

606
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,640
Kill everyone.

607
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,720
I will kill you all.

608
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,840
Kill them.

609
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,200
Kill them now.

610
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,080
(Incanting)

611
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,120
What are you doing?

612
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,160
Exorcising.

613
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,240
He's freaking possessed.

614
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,180
(Incanting)

615
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,640
Stop it, Chai.

616
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,480
That's enough.

617
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,960
He's not the one possessed.

618
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,410
The one who's really possessed

619
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,600
is this bitch.

620
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:48,880
You...

621
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,360
Rae!

622
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,360
Come.

623
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,600
I will kill you all.

624
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:07,990
Rae...

625
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:08,880
Rae...

626
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,760
- Please.
- Rae's surely tough.

627
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,760
She's endured your shit all this time.

628
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,280
Worn! Rae!

629
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,720
We're back!

630
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,360
Did you make us dinner?

631
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,760
We're so hungry.

632
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,240
Got any leftovers?

633
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,680
Are you home, Worn?

634
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:18,960
What's wrong, Jet?

635
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,340
Take a look around.

636
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,480
Actually,

637
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,960
we've gone through this bamboo grove
over and over.

638
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,560
We're being messed with.

639
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,200
Khem!

640
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:06,960
What the fuck is going on?

641
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:14,640
Khem!

642
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,640
Rae...

643
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,880
Make your choice. Who will you save?

644
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,520
Stop that.

645
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,860
Rae!

646
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,440
Rae...

647
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,760
Rae,

648
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,720
please don't do this.

649
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:50,760
I'm sorry.

650
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,760
It's too late.

651
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,160
Your Rae

652
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,680
is gone.

653
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,320
Don't do that!

654
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,360
Rae...

655
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,360
Please don't.

656
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,280
Stop.

657
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,760
You chose to come here.

658
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,160
I suppose that means
my lady's gotten hold of that boy.

659
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,440
Get out of this body.

660
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:40,920
You don't belong here.

661
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,960
She's been dying
to kill that bastard for ages.

662
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,320
I just gave her what she wanted.

663
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,920
It's her choice.

664
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:49,880
Stay out of this.

665
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,720
Don't involve yourself
in karma that isn't yours to carry.

666
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,640
What about those who wronged my lady?

667
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,960
Have they paid for their sins?

668
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,520
This is what Rae wants.

669
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,440
Even you can't stop it.

670
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:15,720
Rae!

671
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,960
Rae...

672
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,040
You'd better not
underestimate me and my disciple.

673
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,560
What the fuck is going on?

674
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:31,360
Khem!

675
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:37,760
Jet,

676
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,000
can you hear me?

677
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,120
Master!

678
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,840
Please help Khem.

679
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,880
Listen.

680
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,780
You need to help him.

681
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:47,560
What?

682
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,480
Why's that?

683
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,060
There's no time to explain.

684
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,320
I'm gonna let you see spirits
for a while.

685
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,280
After that, it's your call.

686
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,920
You can do it, Jet!

687
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:13,880
Ake?

688
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:39,600
Khem!

689
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:48,520
Khem...

690
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,120
Are you alright?

691
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,000
Shit!

692
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,280
Who were they?

693
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:03,970
Jet!

694
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:05,760
This way! Come on.

695
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:07,640
Thong?

696
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,480
Come on, Khem.

697
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,240
Hurry.

698
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:30,760
Rae,

699
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,240
if you can hear me,

700
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,480
follow my voice.

701
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,520
This body is waiting for you.

702
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:44,600
She's not coming back.

703
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,320
Who'd want to live

704
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,280
with a husband drowning in debt,

705
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,400
drinking all day, and beating his wife?

706
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,960
That's just another kind of death.

707
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,480
Come back, Rae.

708
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,320
Handle your own problems.

709
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,960
Don't use a spirit
to do your dirty work.

710
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:14,160
(Incanting)

711
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,880
(Incanting)

712
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,600
My lady won't spare you.

713
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:37,320
(Incanting)

714
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:48,640
Rae!

715
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:49,640
Rae...

716
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,200
Rae!

717
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,600
- Rae...
- Rae.

718
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,160
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

719
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,680
You've done nothing wrong.

720
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:02,920
I was a piece of shit.

721
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,200
Please forgive me.

722
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,280
From now on, I'll quit drinking

723
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:11,000
and focus on paying off my debts.

724
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,840
Forgive me, Rae.

725
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,440
I'm sorry, too.

726
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:34,800
Thank you.

727
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,160
Rae and Worn managed to
rekindle their love

728
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,920
because of your help.

729
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,000
It's too soon to say that.

730
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,120
Things are not that easy.

731
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,600
- What do you mean?
- Jet,

732
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,360
wake Uncle Chai up
and take care of the rest.

733
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:57,920
Yes, Master.

734
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:03,520
Follow me.

735
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Master,

736
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,840
what did you mean it was too soon
to say they'd rekindled their love?

737
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,200
Even if Rae forgives Worn,

738
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,920
he won't really change.

739
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,680
But he did make a promise.

740
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,680
He did,

741
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,000
but that doesn't mean it'll happen.

742
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,520
But I think they're trying.

743
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,480
After all, they still love each other.

744
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,280
Listen, Khem.

745
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,320
Love isn't always enough

746
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,520
to make things work.

747
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,280
If being together
only leads to problems,

748
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,320
why bother?

749
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:00,880
Master,

750
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:06,160
you were willing to help Worn and Rae,

751
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:10,920
yet refused to help me.

752
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,400
Is it just because
I don't belong to this village?

753
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,400
My duty

754
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,640
is to take care
of the people in this village.

755
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,160
I'm an outsider.

756
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,680
I get it now.

757
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:00,720
Still,

758
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:07,600
I'll do whatever it takes
to stop being an outsider in your eyes.

759
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,040
No touching.

760
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,440
I'm sorry.

761
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:11,920
Step up.

762
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:13,490
Oh, gosh...

763
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,240
- Slowly.
- Take it easy.

764
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,800
Careful. You'll bump into the door.

765
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:21,359
How did you end up like this?

766
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:23,560
Take it easy.

767
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:32,680
What have you been up to?

768
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:34,920
Save that for later.

769
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:38,040
For now, let Charn get some rest.

770
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:51,319
Right, Jet.

771
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:55,479
I'll have those three guys
stay somewhere else for the time being.

772
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:57,520
Thanks a lot, Uncle.

773
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,720
Don't worry about him.

774
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,399
He'll be fine.

775
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:27,399
What? Why would I worry about him?

776
01:09:28,359 --> 01:09:30,160
He literally asked for trouble himself.

777
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:36,620
I'm leaving.

778
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:37,960
Good night.

779
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:07,440
Good luck.

780
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,560
Thank you so much.

781
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,480
He came to say goodbye.

782
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,640
He's going to work in the city
for a while

783
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,280
to pay off his debts.

784
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,920
He'll be apart from Rae for a bit.

785
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:05,920
See?

786
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,040
It's not that easy.

787
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
So,

788
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:25,600
was the spirit that possessed Rae
someone from Khem's past karma?

789
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:35,880
She sent her servant spirits
to harm the villagers.

790
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:44,800
I'm sorry.

791
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:53,480
The spirit only stirred up
the resentment that was already there.

792
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:59,480
Sooner or later, Worn and Rae
would've fallen apart anyway.

793
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,600
He's saying...

794
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,040
don't blame yourself.

795
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:09,840
It's not your fault.

796
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,440
- Right, Master...
- When your friend is with us,

797
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,200
you can drop the dialect.

798
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:29,320
Okay.

799
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:30,760
Well...

800
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:34,880
Is there any way I can see spirits again
like I did last night?

801
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,840
I still want another round with them.

802
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,160
Jet!

803
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,320
If I do that,

804
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,160
your parents will beat me up.

805
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,680
Right,

806
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:59,280
a spirit showed up
to save Khem last night.

807
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,600
I caught a glimpse...

808
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,640
It looked like a man...

809
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,840
dressed in khaki.

810
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Khem,

811
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,240
have you seen him before?

812
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:19,080
Yeah.

813
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:21,600
It's him

814
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,960
who keeps showing up.

815
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,640
Long time no see,

816
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:22,600
Wat.

817
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:05,960
Do you know that spirit?

818
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:06,720
It's none of your business.

819
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:07,600
You literally said,

820
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:08,760
"He's not the Khemmika you knew."

821
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,000
You talked about me, didn't you?

822
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,060
See that sign over there?

823
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:12,720
It used to be a viewpoint.

824
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:14,460
How about we pitch a tent
and do some stargazing tonight?

825
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,240
I've got a long-range rifle, baby!

826
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,880
Hey, are you done yet?

827
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:19,660
Jet,

828
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,640
help Uncle Chai
gather the entire village.

829
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:24,160
We'll form search groups
to look for Te, Korn, and Phu.

830
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:25,280
They must be found before noon.

831
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,880
Why before noon?

832
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,840
If they're not found by noon,

833
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:29,880
we're looking for bodies.

834
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:37,560
♫No matter how long time's passed,
you still have me♫

835
