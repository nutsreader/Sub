1
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,000
At this moment,

2
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,680
someone seeks to take my life.

3
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,120
If anyone has clues, report to me at once.

4
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,800
This group you mentioned,

5
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,200
what exactly is it?

6
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,600
The Viwat People,

7
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,320
founded by Banjong.

8
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,320
We all share the same goal,

9
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,280
to dethrone King Chaiyached.

10
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,840
I had my men infiltrate Lord Kosol’s estate

11
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,720
and they found this map.

12
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,240
I’m not the only one plotting rebellion.

13
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,680
Somdet Saenyakorn is
after the throne as well.

14
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,960
You killed young bunny before my eyes,
how could I possibly eat?

15
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,479
You, too, have a charm that entices me.

16
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,560
Oh!

17
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,320
It’s like…

18
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,760
something just brushed against my leg.

19
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,160
The giant snakehead fish I keep.

20
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:31,760
Some fish just swam into my leg too.

21
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,320
My own snakehead.

22
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,600
Kosol.

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,480
I…

24
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,600
may I play with your little one for a bit?

25
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,720
Go ahead.

26
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,760
Careful, it might bite.

27
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,160
Wait.

28
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,640
Why?

29
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,720
Did I hurt your little one?

30
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,240
Someone’s coming.

31
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,079
Stay here and wait for me.

32
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,520
I’ll lure them away.

33
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,520
Like this, In this state?

34
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,280
Go.

35
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,520
What are you dawdling for, Kosol?

36
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,200
You left me here alone
on purpose, didn’t you?

37
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,800
I even washed your clothes.

38
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,080
Don’t make me wash them for nothing.

39
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,160
Who’s there?

40
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,760
I said, who’s there?

41
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,840
I said, who’s there?

42
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,120
Kosol?

43
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,080
Kosol.

44
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,240
Didn’t know you actually cared about me.

45
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,080
Of course I care.

46
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,480
We’re the only two humans in this forest.

47
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,240
If something happened to you,

48
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,000
how would I survive?

49
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,520
Don’t make me worry like
that again, understand?

50
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,080
I can’t promise you that.

51
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,159
Because I was born to face danger.

52
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,760
What I can promise you is...

53
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,200
I swear,

54
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,960
every time I survive and return,

55
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,320
I will come back to you.

56
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,160
Really?

57
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,120
I… I think…

58
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,800
you should get dressed first.

59
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,480
Stop swinging back and forth like that.

60
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,400
What leaf is this?

61
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,760
Smells so strong.

62
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,360
Wild basil leaves.

63
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,800
What do you use it for?

64
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,400
Rub it on to keep mosquitoes away.

65
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,880
You can be kind, you know.

66
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,000
Do you know that when you’re kind,

67
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,120
you’re actually very sweet?

68
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,640
No, I’m not being kind.

69
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,840
I just don’t want to see
you die of malaria.

70
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,159
That’s exactly what being kind is.

71
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,159
No. When I say no, I mean no.

72
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,640
Fine.

73
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,920
No means no.

74
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,600
You’re a wicked man.

75
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,880
Your heart’s as rough
as the soles of my feet.

76
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,320
Satisfied now?

77
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,560
I think the reason
I’d take poison isn’t heartbreak.

78
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,240
It’s because you’re like this.

79
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,440
Anyone living with you would go insane.

80
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,840
Why do you blame only me?

81
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,040
Don’t you think Banjong
might be at fault too?

82
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,800
You knew about me and Banjong?

83
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,200
Tell me about it.

84
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,120
Of course. I’m not a fool.

85
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,520
And I also know you two
exchanged long love poems.

86
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,120
So what did you do?

87
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,920
Did you beat me?

88
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,200
Or did you go thrash Banjong?

89
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,000
Tell me, Kosol.

90
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,480
Tell me.

91
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,800
If I had,

92
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,280
neither of you would still be alive today.

93
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,080
Then why did you just let it go?

94
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,520
Kosol Kosol!

95
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,400
Come back, Kosol.

96
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,960
Kosol.

97
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,920
Kosol!

98
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,560
Kosol, hey,

99
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,480
tell me first. Hey!

100
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,480
Don’t you fake sleep,
just got here, no way you’re out.

101
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,200
Wake up. Wake up, Kosol.

102
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,960
Hey, wake up.

103
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,000
Hey.

104
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,560
Tell me right now.

105
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,320
About me, you, and Banjong,

106
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,560
what was going on?

107
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,960
I want to know what happened
before I took poison.

108
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,280
You used to be quiet.

109
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,680
Didn’t talk much.

110
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,280
Are you saying I talk too much now?

111
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,880
Not just too much,

112
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,160
now you’re loud, brash,

113
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,000
and sharp-tongued.

114
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,120
Even though I used to teach you better,

115
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,640
you never got it right.

116
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,960
Today I’ll give you a new lesson.

117
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,320
Try cursing someone out for me.

118
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,680
Why would I do that?

119
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,640
I’ve got no reason to curse anyone.

120
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,200
Just imagine someone hurt you deeply.

121
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,840
You’d get mad and let it out.

122
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,480
Go on, try.

123
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,440
You… bad person.

124
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,840
Was that a curse or a lullaby?

125
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,400
Make it harsher.

126
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,960
Repeat after me.

127
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,400
Worthless scum.

128
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,160
Is that really okay?

129
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,800
We’re human.

130
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,880
Shouldn’t we talk things out calmly?

131
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,720
Throwing insults,

132
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,760
it won’t make things better.

133
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,760
But it’s satisfying, isn’t it?

134
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,360
Come on, say it again, worthless scum.

135
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,560
Worth… less scum.

136
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,520
- Louder.
- Worthless scum.

137
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,760
Yeah.

138
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,160
That’s more like it.

139
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,600
I used to teach you hundreds of times,

140
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,160
you never pulled it off.

141
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,160
But today you did it
without me even trying.

142
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,520
Might’ve even cursed harsher than me.

143
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,160
You’re always bossing me around.

144
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,080
I used to be meek, just let me be meek.

145
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,800
Why bother with me?

146
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,080
Because you’re the one

147
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,480
who asked me to make you stronger.

148
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,400
You said if you stayed weak and spineless,

149
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,560
you’d never reach your goal.

150
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,640
You know…

151
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,760
what my desire is?

152
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,640
Tell me, Kosol.

153
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,400
I honestly forgot.

154
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,200
Your desire,

155
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,600
is this.

156
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,240
Worradej.

157
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,080
This is really your desire?

158
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,200
You called me from the future

159
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,480
just to kiss a man?

160
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,480
But with a kiss this sweet,

161
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,160
I’m not surprised

162
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,800
that this would be your desire.

163
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,520
I’ve kissed you now.

164
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,360
So I can go home, right?

165
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,160
One.

166
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,840
Two.

167
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,040
Three.

168
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,600
Hup.

169
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,480
What? Still not home.

170
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,360
What’s with you?

171
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,120
It’s your first night here,

172
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,360
you already wanna go?

173
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,440
Didn’t you say you didn’t
want to see your father again?

174
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,680
Why go back then?

175
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,080
Not that home.

176
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
If not that home, then where?

177
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,360
Even if I say it, no one will get it.

178
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,360
I get it.

179
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,400
Must be the poison making you hallucinate.

180
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,640
Rest a bit more, you’ll feel better.

181
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,400
Don’t worry.

182
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I’ll stay by your side.

183
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,880
Come to think of it,

184
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,560
a world with this giant rascal in it

185
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,680
isn’t so bad after all.

186
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,560
The soldiers I sent with the royal decree
to arrest Count Kosol,

187
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,720
were killed, their bodies dumped
by the forest edge.

188
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,680
I’ve come to report the rebel’s brutality.

189
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,680
He must be executed, Your Majesty.

190
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,120
No. Didn’t I already order,

191
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,400
Kosol be put through the fire ritual
to prove his innocence?

192
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,120
How can you kill him now?

193
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,160
But such a brazen act,

194
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,960
clearly shows Count Kosol defied
Your Majesty’s command.

195
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,840
It proves his treason beyond doubt.

196
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,040
There’s no need for further proof.

197
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Kosol may have killed the soldiers
in self-defense.

198
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,240
That doesn’t mean he’s the one
who tried to assassinate me.

199
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,600
I don’t care. Either way,

200
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,520
I want to see Kosol walk through
the flames before me.

201
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,800
Understood.

202
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,800
As you wish, Your Majesty.

203
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,000
Your Majesty.

204
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,520
But if there’s a clash during the arrest,

205
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,800
and Count Kosol ends up dead,

206
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,720
it will be deemed unavoidable.

207
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,440
And where is Kosol now?

208
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,840
Last seen hiding in the western forest,
Your Majesty.

209
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,880
I haven’t been to the forest in ages.

210
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,440
I’ll come along then.

211
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,640
Chit, go get the bug-catching box.

212
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,880
I bet in that forest,

213
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,360
there are plenty of strange insects.

214
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

215
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,960
What’s that smell? Smells so good.

216
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,680
It’s little bunny.

217
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,080
Here.

218
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,040
That’s the second bunny you’ve killed.

219
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,520
What if it has a family? Then what?

220
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,280
Don’t you feel sorry for it?

221
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,080
Go wash up and eat.

222
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,560
We need to head out.

223
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,760
Where are we heading this time?

224
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,880
Haven’t we gone deep enough
into the forest?

225
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,600
We’ll head back to the city
and hide at Banjong’s place.

226
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,840
If we stay in the forest,
we won’t survive.

227
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,240
With you being this delicate,

228
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,120
you should’ve thought of that yesterday.

229
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,800
If you had thought of it yesterday,

230
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,640
we wouldn’t have had to suffer
here all night.

231
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,560
But...

232
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,040
before we go back,

233
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,080
I...

234
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,720
can I bathe with you
one more time?

235
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,960
Right here, Your Majesty.

236
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,880
Where the soldiers’ bodies
were dumped.

237
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,440
We believe Count Kosol
is hiding in this part of the forest.

238
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,160
Chit.

239
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,080
I heard there are plenty of
beautiful insects here.

240
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,240
Lead the way.

241
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

242
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,720
The fire just burned out.

243
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,960
They might still be nearby.

244
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,160
Search the area.

245
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,720
Two pillows.

246
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,960
That means there are two of them.

247
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,360
And who’s the other one?

248
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,960
Oh, dear brother.

249
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,960
If you’re going to camp out in the forest,

250
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,760
And you didn’t even invite me along.

251
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,000
You picked a great spot too.

252
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,040
Chit.

253
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,520
Do you hear a waterfall?

254
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,800
I do, Your Majesty.

255
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,320
Count.

256
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,280
Let me take a quick swim.

257
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,800
But we’re here to catch
a criminal, Your Majesty.

258
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,200
Let’s finish Count Kosol’s case first.

259
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,920
Then you can come back
to enjoy yourself later.

260
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,440
Count.

261
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,640
We searched everywhere
but didn’t find him.

262
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,080
Only two sets of footprints.

263
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,240
- Heading north.
- Follow them.

264
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,680
Yes, Count.

265
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,920
Kosol.

266
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,400
Where are you?

267
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,480
I’ve come to arrest you.

268
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,880
Come out quietly.

269
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,000
Your Majesty.

270
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,680
Please keep it down.

271
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,560
You’ll tip them off.

272
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,280
Oh, is that so?

273
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,880
Didn’t think of that.

274
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,560
The forest air’s refreshing though.

275
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,640
When this is over, let's
come back here again, Kosol.

276
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah?

277
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,760
When this is over,
let's come here again.

278
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
Don't act like
you're too happy.

279
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,080
Have you forgotten

280
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,600
you're my hostage

281
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,200
and I'm running
from the law for treason?

282
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,640
Go on. Lead the way.

283
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,760
Yes.

284
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,680
Don't run.

285
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,560
Come out quietly.

286
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,760
Come out.

287
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,320
- Wait, wait.
- What now?

288
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,480
I heard someone shouting.

289
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,800
Could it be soldiers
coming after us?

290
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,120
Probably. Sounds like Chaiyached.

291
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,040
They must've brought
soldiers to catch us.

292
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,840
So what do we do now?

293
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,680
Can you run for long?

294
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,080
I think they're still far off.

295
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,720
If we start running now,

296
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,320
they won't catch up.

297
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,560
I can handle it.

298
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,200
I’ve done Zumba
classes for hours.

299
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
Chid, Chid! Follow me, quick.

300
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,440
- This one's beautiful.
- Yes.

301
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,320
Hey.

302
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,040
Your Majesty.

303
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,080
If we keep dawdling like this,
we won’t catch Kosol in time.

304
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,280
Are you saying I’m dawdling?

305
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,200
I just stopped to catch
a few insects.

306
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,080
If you want me to walk faster,
I might not manage.

307
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,160
Better to take it slow like this.

308
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,000
Lead the way.

309
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,160
Yes.

310
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,600
Soldier.

311
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,400
The troops I ordered,
are they ready?

312
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,720
All set, sir.

313
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,320
They’re lying in wait
at the north edge of the forest.

314
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,680
If Kosol comes out, he’ll be caught.

315
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,320
Go.

316
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,160
Careful, Your Majesty.

317
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,760
I never took a long jump class.

318
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,800
You okay?

319
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,240
No. Can we rest first?

320
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,520
Then get on my back.

321
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,320
What?

322
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,320
If the soldiers catch up,
we’re done for.

323
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,720
Chid, follow me.

324
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,080
I have to catch this insect.

325
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,280
Yes.

326
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,080
- Keep up with him!
- Wait for me, Your Majesty!

327
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,360
How am I supposed to help?

328
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,360
Brother.

329
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,320
Oh my, that’s Father.

330
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,400
This time I’ve caught up
to you at last.

331
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,800
Give yourself up nicely
so I won’t have to use force.

332
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,640
Thing is, I rather like
using force.

333
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,040
Better tell your soldiers
to come at me all at once.

334
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,240
Seize him!

335
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,200
Go on, grab him!

336
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,040
Why are you in the way?
I’m taking care of Kosol.

337
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,360
Worradej.

338
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,720
How did you end up here?

339
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,400
I took him hostage.

340
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,200
Tell your soldiers to back off.

341
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,160
Or if you don’t care about
your son’s life, say so.

342
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,160
I’ll slit his throat right now.

343
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,960
Count, do you still
need to think about it?

344
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,760
Choose Worradej’s life first.

345
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,920
Deal with catching Kosol later.

346
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,720
Don’t follow me.

347
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,320
I’m grateful to you both.

348
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,360
From here, I can get
into the city myself.

349
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,560
You two go back and
keep an eye on Chaiyached.

350
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,960
Please take care, sir.

351
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,280
Mm.

352
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,400
You care for your brother so much
you have him followed everywhere?

353
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,080
No, I’m not worried about him.

354
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,160
I just want to keep an eye on him
to track his movements.

355
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,760
Like this time, we were lucky.

356
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,440
We made it in time to help.

357
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,760
Right.

358
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,240
I forgot you’re heartless.

359
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,480
No way you’d care about anyone.

360
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,160
You just had a sword to my throat.

361
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,440
Let’s see if you’re hurt.

362
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,640
Don’t touch me.

363
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,480
I’m just your hostage.

364
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,760
Even if I die, it wouldn’t
matter to you anyway.

365
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,800
Fine, sulk if you want.

366
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,440
Don’t think I’ll coax you.

367
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,520
I never wanted you to anyway.

368
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,600
How did you get here?

369
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,600
Come inside quickly.

370
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,840
Good thing.

371
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,440
You had people follow
Prince Chaiyached.

372
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,920
We made it in time to save him.

373
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,240
Brother Kosol, are you hurt anywhere?

374
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,960
Let me tend to your wounds.

375
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,640
Just a few bruises.

376
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,080
It’ll heal soon.

377
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,680
Nothing serious.

378
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,160
And you, Worradej?

379
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,800
Are you hurt anywhere?

380
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,160
At first I was fine.

381
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,720
But nearly died
with a sword at my throat.

382
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,920
If I hadn’t done that,

383
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,760
would we be here eating
while you sass me like this?

384
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,640
I wasn’t blaming you.

385
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,080
Why make a fuss?

386
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,480
I risked myself as a hostage
and still got scolded.

387
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,160
Weren’t you the one
who brought your father to catch Kosol?

388
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,400
Don’t play dumb.

389
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,840
Don’t you accuse me.

390
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,840
Even if he’s my father,
I had nothing to do with it.

391
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,400
If not you, then who?

392
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,480
- How would I know? If you wanna know,
- Enough.

393
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,400
While you’re hiding here,

394
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,480
don’t go out where people can see you.

395
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,200
The Count must have men
searching the city.

396
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,040
But they likely won’t come here.

397
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,000
Unless some loose tongue tells my father.

398
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,480
Who are you calling that, Pandao?

399
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,920
If you’re feeling guilty, take it.
I was just saying.

400
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,960
Just saying? There are plenty
of the Count’s children here.

401
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,400
- If you mean me, just say it.
- So what?

402
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,440
- So what?
- What then?

403
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,560
Water.

404
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,720
Thanks.

405
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,400
Here, water.

406
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,880
Thank you.

407
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,920
Pandao.

408
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,200
The room might be a bit small.

409
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,240
Not as big as the Count’s house.

410
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,280
But it should do, right?

411
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,400
Of course. It’s fine.

412
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,200
If you need anything,

413
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,720
just tell me anytime.

414
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,600
Get some rest.

415
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,800
I’ll leave you be.

416
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,640
Wait, Banjong.

417
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,760
I…

418
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,200
I have something to ask you.

419
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,040
Sun and moon in the vast sky.

420
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,680
You wrote this verse for me, didn’t you?

421
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,400
Your memories…

422
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,040
they’ve returned?

423
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,480
I found this paper in my room.

424
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,880
Yes.

425
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,160
I wrote it for you myself.

426
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,920
And?

427
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,280
What does this poem mean?

428
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,960
Tell me.

429
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,680
It doesn’t hold
any deep meaning.

430
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,880
Just idle talk
about the weather.

431
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,040
Don’t think too much of it.

432
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,240
I’d better get some sleep.
I’m exhausted.

433
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,320
Wait, Banjong.

434
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,440
If it’s just idle talk
about the weather,

435
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,480
why would you
write me a poem?

436
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,640
Tell me right now

437
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,240
what this thing between us really is.

438
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,320
We work together.

439
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,360
We’re in the same Viwat People group.

440
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,680
We’re good friends.

441
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,840
And one day…

442
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,840
Banjong.

443
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,120
Worradej.

444
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,880
Did you give the tax ledger
to the Count to sign?

445
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,840
I did.

446
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,280
Father is reviewing it now.

447
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,000
It’ll take him a while,
so I came to see you first.

448
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,360
I have something
I want to talk to you about.

449
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,920
What is it?

450
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,680
Go on.

451
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,120
So…

452
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,080
I know what I’m about to say

453
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,560
might sound strange.

454
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,000
And it might make you
feel uncomfortable.

455
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,400
But I’ve thought it through.

456
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,640
I should tell you

457
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,960
rather than keep it
to myself alone.

458
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,240
Banjong.

459
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,280
I love you.

460
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,680
You’re the sun.

461
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,280
I’m the moon.

462
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,160
In the vast sky.

463
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,840
In the day,

464
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,240
I shine bright.

465
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,640
You drift away.

466
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,720
When I fade,

467
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,960
you return to light the night.

468
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,840
It’s always been

469
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,640
and will always be

470
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,680
this way through time.

471
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,440
After that day,

472
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,200
we stayed friends as before.

473
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,680
And no one spoke of it again.

474
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,600
The meaning of the poem is,

475
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,720
Even if the sun and moon
share the same sky,

476
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,120
they can never cross paths.

477
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,520
Why not?

478
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,280
We’re in the same group.

479
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,000
We share the same ideals.

480
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,320
Why can’t we love each other?

481
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,480
Since you’ve asked,

482
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,000
I’ll tell you everything.

483
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,880
So there’s no doubt left.

484
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,000
Back then,

485
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,800
I was just a commoner.

486
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,200
My parents

487
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,760
were taken to serve in
a nobleman’s house.

488
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,680
They were worked to the bone

489
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,600
and both died.

490
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,800
From that day on,

491
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,880
I hated all nobles.

492
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,560
But being born the son of a Lord,

493
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,440
that’s not your fault, Worradej.

494
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,640
It’s just…

495
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,360
a deep wound

496
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,440
for someone who was once a commoner.

497
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,080
That’s all it is.

498
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,200
That’s all I have to say.

499
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,560
Banjong turns down Worradej.

500
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,560
And… Banjong was the first
to find Worradej’s body.

501
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,120
Then Kosol said,

502
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,880
why do you only blame me?

503
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,240
Haven’t you thought
it could be Banjong?

504
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,200
That’s right.

505
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,480
It must be Banjong.

506
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,640
He was Worradej’s lover.

507
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,320
And it was Banjong

508
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,120
who drove Worradej
to take his own life.

509
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,080
And Worradej’s wish

510
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,280
must be around here somewhere.

511
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,800
No need for Conan.

512
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,000
I can solve the mystery myself.

513
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,840
Soon, I’ll be able
to go back home.

514
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,280
Back to my beloved concert.

515
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,000
This is me.

516
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,760
This is me.

517
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,080
Queen. Mommy.

518
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,240
Mother. Fierce.

519
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,760
It’s me, Jade, my lord.
It’s me.

520
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,760
Jade?

521
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,920
You startled me.

522
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
How did you even get in here?

523
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,120
I didn’t want to wake
anyone in the house,

524
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,840
so I snuck in through the window.

525
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,320
Seeing that you’re still safe,

526
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,320
that’s enough to make me happy.

527
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,520
How did you even know I was here?

528
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,840
The Count came back to the manor
and made a scene.

529
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,239
He said you ran away with Lord Kosol.

530
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,760
I guessed you might’ve
escaped to this place.

531
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,280
So I came to check.

532
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,400
My lord,

533
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,159
from now on, I won’t ever
leave your side again.

534
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,280
I’ll follow you everywhere.

535
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,440
Please don’t send me away again.

536
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,639
- Please.
- All right, all right.

537
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,920
Let’s talk about it tomorrow.

538
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,679
For now, get some sleep.

539
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,480
Come, sleep here with me.

540
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,840
I can’t, my lord.

541
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,199
I’m just a servant.

542
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,120
I’m used to sleeping on a plank.

543
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,960
What servant nonsense?

544
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,000
You’re my friend.

545
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,679
Come, sleep with me.

546
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,199
I can’t, my lord.
I’ve never slept on a mattress.

547
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,400
I’m afraid I won’t sleep well.

548
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,199
Better to sleep on a plank.

549
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,840
You go ahead and sleep.

550
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,520
Suit yourself then.

551
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,960
Here, take this.

552
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,960
Take it.

553
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,520
Thank you so much, my lord.

554
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,200
What’s that smell? It’s lovely.

555
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,680
Jasmine, my lord.

556
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,600
If you wake up to the scent
of fresh flowers,

557
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,760
it’ll keep you refreshed all day.

558
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,280
Please wash your face first, my lord.
I’ve prepared warm water.

559
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,320
That Worradej.

560
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,000
Hey.

561
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,040
Are you out of your mind, Pandao?

562
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,760
Where did you take P’Kosol?

563
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,080
Take him where? I don’t know
what you’re talking about.

564
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,320
P’Kosol’s gone from the house.

565
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,800
How the hell were you
watching your master?

566
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,080
Letting that bastard Kosol
kidnap him like that?

567
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,800
Answer me!

568
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,080
I don’t know, my lord.

569
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,320
Have you found the Count, my lord?

570
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,680
Of course I have.

571
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,360
Kosol took Worradej hostage.

572
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,960
But then again…

573
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,600
I think he might’ve gone
and offered himself up.

574
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,600
So where is the Count now?

575
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,880
How would I know where they ran off to?

576
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,400
If you hadn’t let Worradej get caught,

577
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,240
I’d have Kosol by now.

578
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,880
Get out of my sight. Now.

579
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,280
Yes, my lord.

580
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,080
Keep an eye on that Jade.

581
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,040
He might know where Kosol
and Worradej are.

582
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,400
Kosol’s a cautious man.

583
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,640
In a tense situation like this,

584
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,680
he wouldn’t just stroll out
without telling anyone.

585
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,320
I think…

586
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,560
Kosol must’ve been taken.

587
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,840
But how…

588
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,760
is anyone’s guess.

589
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,880
Don’t look at me like that.

590
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,040
I’m this tiny, I couldn’t drag him
more than an inch.

591
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,280
I didn’t see a thing, my lord.

592
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,840
Jade’s just a servant.

593
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,920
He wouldn’t dare touch
Lord Kosol.

594
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,960
If it’s not you two, then who?

595
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,480
This isn’t the time for blame.

596
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,280
Let’s figure out first

597
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,040
where we might find Kosol.

598
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,120
- Banjong.
- Banjong.

599
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,040
- Banjong.
- Banjong.

600
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,680
- Banjong.
- Stay here.

601
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,960
- He’s one of mine.
- Banjong.

602
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
- Banjong.
- Go open it.

603
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,240
Banjong.

604
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,520
Banjong.

605
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,280
Banjong.

606
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,720
The authorities posted at the market.

607
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,080
In two days, Kosol will face
the fire ordeal

608
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,120
to prove his innocence
in King Chaiyached’s murder.

609
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,160
The fire ordeal’s basically
a death sentence.

610
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,600
We have to save Brother Kosol.

611
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,080
Brother Banjong, what do we do?

612
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,320
I’ll speak to King Chaiyached myself.

613
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,200
Sir, wait for me, please.

614
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,720
My lord.

615
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,400
Banjong, letting Worradej
stay this close to you,

616
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,000
aren’t you afraid
there’ll be more trouble?

617
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,760
Kosol’s capture,

618
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,280
that was his doing.

619
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,920
It couldn’t have been anyone else.

620
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,160
Brother Banjong.

621
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,120
We all agree Worradej’s the problem.

622
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,880
He betrayed our group once before.

623
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,880
And now this happens again.

624
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,800
We need to get rid of him fast.

625
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,960
Otherwise, our Viwat People group
will fall apart before we reach our goal.

626
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,640
Just a little, please, dear brother.

627
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,080
Count, please don’t try
to bribe us.

628
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,280
If I say you can’t go in,
you can’t go in.

629
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,760
If I let you in, Count,

630
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,000
my head would surely roll.

631
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,560
I know that.

632
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,600
I’m not trying to force my way in.

633
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,840
I just want to get to know you all.

634
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,160
In case in the future

635
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,200
there’s something we
need to help each other with.

636
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,760
So we know each other first.

637
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,680
Come on, brother, just a sip.

638
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,280
It’s delicious.

639
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,360
We can’t drink on duty, Count.

640
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,360
Just one more watch
and we’re off, please wait.

641
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,400
Oh.

642
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,760
I already opened the jar by mistake.

643
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,880
Oh no.

644
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,600
If I leave it open,

645
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,800
the aroma will fade away.

646
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,960
Hmm. Smells so good, really good.

647
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,040
Here, have a whiff.

648
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,360
This is fine fermented rice wine.

649
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,520
Just one gulp, brother.

650
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,720
Wake up.

651
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,280
Wake up, wake up now.

652
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,680
Sir.

653
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,400
They’re both out cold, sir.

654
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,400
So much for “just one gulp.”

655
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,080
Is this rice wine or a sedative?

656
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,200
With this brew, even elephants drop.

657
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,640
Let’s go.

658
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,440
I forgot, the bolt’s on the inside.

659
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,760
Huh?

660
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,240
Then better climb the wall.

661
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,840
Step on my back, sir.

662
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,880
- Step on you?
- Go ahead.

663
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,920
Go ahead, sir.

664
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,240
Push, sir.

665
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,600
Pushing.

666
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,960
More, go on, sir.

667
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,200
Almost there.

668
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,520
Ow.

669
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,160
Ever since I came to the past,

670
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,600
it’s been non-stop adventure, Prince.

671
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,880
Something new every time.

672
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,200
Jade, climb up.

673
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,400
Yes, sir.

674
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,760
Careful, careful.

675
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,400
I’ll pull the rope for you.

676
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,920
Sir… Sir.

677
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,280
Sir.

678
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,640
Stop. Stop.

679
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,960
Let go.

680
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,240
- Stop.
- Let me go.

681
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,960
Sir.

682
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,640
- Stop. Stop.
- Let me go.

683
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,280
What did you say?

684
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,960
Worradej got shot?

685
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,480
And what did you get from
talking to Kosol?

686
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,960
The fire trial will be
our day of victory.

687
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,680
The reason I came today

688
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,560
is to invite you to break out.

689
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,320
Or if you’ve forgotten,

690
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,000
I’ll refresh your memory
through these bars.

691
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,280
I’ll just take you in
as my page boy.

692
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,680
I’m not fit for that, sir.

693
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,120
Jade, smack my butt.

694
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,480
Kiss me and say goodnight.

695
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,480
Banjong.

696
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,680
Sir. Sir.

697
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,200
Sir.

698
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,640
Cut.

699
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,680
Slate.

700
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,680
Help the Count first.
(The Count’s got blisters.)

701
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,840
(The Count’s got blisters.)

702
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,920
(Everyone, look at this.)

703
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,440
(Rope burn.)

704
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,640
(Dedication level: insane.)

705
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,760
I’m fine.
(Dedication level: insane.)

706
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,560
That’s so scary.

707
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,840
Hurry up, you useless thing.

708
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,840
(Don’t scold me, please.)

709
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,160
Prince, come back.
(Please give us Prince back.)

710
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,240
Prince.
(Please give us Prince back.)

711
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,480
Good thing

712
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,840
Etan had men follow King Chaiyached.
(Which Tan?)

713
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,440
Keep rolling.
(It’s getting spicy.)

714
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,960
- First word wasn’t clear, son.
- Sorry.

715
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,640
Okay, rewind, son.
