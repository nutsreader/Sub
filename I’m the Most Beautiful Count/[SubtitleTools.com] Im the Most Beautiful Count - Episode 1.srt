1
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,840
Welcome to the most glamorous show

2
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,640
in the land of Saenya—

3
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,400
Saenya Tonight!

4
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,560
And tonight,

5
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,280
you’ll be meeting a singer
adored by half the nation—

6
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,600
and absolutely hated by the other half.

7
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,160
Every event she joins,

8
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,320
every appearance she makes—

9
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,000
the cops knock on her door
the very next morning.

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,720
But she doesn’t care one bit.

11
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,920
And now, the moment is here.

12
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,240
Please welcome Prince—

13
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,600
and her brand-new single,

14
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,040
“This is Me.”

15
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,600
Well, my life is fabulous anyway.

16
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,920
So make your choice
before you close your eyes.

17
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
- Save it.
- Slay.

18
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,960
Save.

19
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,200
Gorgeous.

20
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,079
- Hey.
- Nat.

21
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,200
Take a pic of me real quick,
I’m sending it to a guy.

22
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,720
Okay, okay, wow.

23
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,880
Strike a good pose.

24
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,520
Okay.

25
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,120
One, two, three.

26
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,240
Fabulous.

27
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,880
- Did it come out good?
- Let’s see.

28
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,240
Let me send it to him first.

29
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,480
Prince is ready!

30
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,240
Oh my god, look at all the men.

31
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,680
There’s a whole crowd over here too.

32
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,800
Are those fans?

33
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,960
Haters, you ready?

34
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,760
- Get out.
- Get out.

35
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,480
- Get out.
- Get out.

36
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,800
- Get out.
- Get out.

37
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,080
- Get out.
- Get out.

38
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,920
- Get out.
- Get out.

39
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,280
- Get out.
- Get out.

40
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,960
- Get out.
- Get out.

41
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,080
(Freaking tranny)
(Shame on you - Disgusting pervert.)

42
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,880
- Get out.
- Get out.

43
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,000
- Get out.
- Get out.

44
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,320
- Get out.
- Get out.

45
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,600
- Get out.
- Get out.

46
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,360
Just for confidence.

47
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,480
Oh—this is the women’s restroom.

48
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,160
When will this world

49
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,920
stop dividing us by male and female?

50
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,200
Welcome to heaven, Prince.

51
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,960
Where is this?

52
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,840
Is this a guy’s house?

53
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,800
Who the hell did I go home with last night?

54
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,520
Is that the guy I slept with?

55
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,880
A g-... ghost?

56
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,080
Wait for me!

57
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Let’s go. Let’s go.

58
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,360
What kind of ghost is this pretty?

59
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,640
You.

60
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,800
What’s wrong with those people?

61
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,800
They’re just scared of you, sir.

62
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,120
Wait... sir, you’re not actually dead?

63
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,640
Me? Dead?

64
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,680
Queens don’t die easy, babe.

65
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,840
And… where exactly is this place?

66
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,440
Is this your house?

67
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,960
Then… that means...

68
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,960
Last night…

69
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,520
Did something happen between us?

70
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,240
Uh… something?

71
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,280
Something what, sir?

72
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,680
This is your room, sir.

73
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,280
My room?

74
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,720
Or is this some kind of spa?

75
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
But...

76
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,440
I didn’t book any spa.

77
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,320
I’ve got rehearsal all day today.

78
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
What the—

79
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,520
My hair!

80
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,720
It’s fried!

81
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,600
Ugh!

82
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,280
Who the hell dressed me in this?

83
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,960
I’ve got it!

84
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,640
This has to be some kind of reality show.

85
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,840
But do they go this far nowadays?

86
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,120
Drugging me?

87
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,040
Putting me in a traditional outfit?

88
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,000
Redoing my whole look?

89
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,680
And then...

90
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
A camera—

91
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,760
Where’s the camera? Where is it?

92
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
Where is it?

93
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,600
Wow, hidden pretty well.

94
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,240
What are you saying, sir?

95
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,040
I don’t understand.

96
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,560
Hmph.

97
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,680
So, you're playing the servant, right?

98
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,600
Fine. You wanna play? Let’s play.

99
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,120
But just so you know—

100
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,880
If the show’s pulling this much on me...

101
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,400
I’m gonna charge a premium, darling.

102
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,360
Well, since we're doing this...

103
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,160
I might as well go full diva on you.

104
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,640
One, two, three...

105
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,240
Action!

106
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,560
Sir, sir, where are you going?

107
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,680
Wow.

108
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,400
Hey, is this show like period-themed or what?

109
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,280
Then what should my character's name be?

110
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,560
Ubon? Lady Karakade?

111
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,960
Or Nang Wanthong?

112
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,680
Worradej.

113
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,080
Whose name is that? So tacky.

114
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,800
You're seriously not dead.

115
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Hello there, Uncle.

116
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,200
What part are you playing, huh?

117
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,000
You wake up and go nuts?

118
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,680
Should’ve just died and saved us all.

119
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,840
Now you're just a curse on this household.

120
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,760
Such strong energy.

121
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,840
But seriously, Uncle, what role are you playing?

122
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,760
So I can act along properly.

123
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,240
Hey, you—

124
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,160
What role is this uncle
playing so I can match it?

125
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,520
Uh... he's the noble father
of the young master, sir.

126
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,240
Got it.

127
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Strict dad who hates queers, classic trope.

128
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
Alright then.

129
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,560
Let me show you how it’s done.

130
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,720
Ouch!

131
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,880
Dear noble father!

132
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,160
Your child has not yet perished, my lord!

133
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,000
Until my dreams are fulfilled—

134
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,880
The day I win seven Grammy Awards—

135
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,760
Every single one of them!

136
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,280
Only then will I
tui ye wa ta na be aiko, my lord!

137
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,320
What? You don’t believe me?

138
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,080
Then, dear noble father, have a listen—

139
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,040
To my brand-new single.

140
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,840
See if it might win me any awards.

141
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,600
Well? Was it fabulous?

142
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,720
Applause, please. Come on, applause!

143
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,040
Clap for me, now!

144
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,960
So what do you think, noble father? Was it fierce?

145
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,800
- Ugh
- Sir!

146
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,160
Hey, Uncle!

147
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,280
What kind of acting is that?

148
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,120
You're not even supporting your co-star!

149
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
Ever heard of camera angles?

150
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,920
You must be possessed by some evil spirit.

151
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,880
I’ll beat you till it leaves your body.

152
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,720
Will you leave my child or not?

153
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,240
Will you leave— Jade, get out of the way!

154
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,560
Will you leave my child or not?

155
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,600
Will you leave? Huh? Will you?

156
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,960
That’s enough.

157
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,080
Stop it right now.

158
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,600
Cut the drama, with that damn stick.

159
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,840
Quit playing around already.

160
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,680
Stop playing?

161
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,760
Sir. Sir!

162
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,200
Sir!

163
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,080
Lock him up in the house.

164
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,800
Don’t let him go out
and shame us in front of the villagers.

165
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,560
Having a lunatic for a son is a disgrace.

166
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,880
Yes, sir.

167
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,320
Sir!

168
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,480
Sir!

169
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,560
My Lord.

170
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,840
Who are you?

171
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,560
And where am I?

172
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,480
Tell me, please.

173
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,560
You are me.

174
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And you're now in my place.

175
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,880
And you must help fulfill my deepest desire.

176
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,640
What desire?

177
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,160
What is it that you want?

178
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,080
My desire…

179
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,920
…is the same as yours.

180
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,840
My desire...

181
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,760
...is your desire.

182
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,680
My desire...

183
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,480
...is your desire.

184
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,080
My desire is your desire.

185
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,480
Wait.

186
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,640
Where did she go?

187
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,520
Hold on.

188
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,320
Come back here.

189
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,240
We’re not done talking.

190
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,720
Hey, come back.

191
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,520
We’re not done talking.

192
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,760
You ancient ghost.

193
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,400
Come back here.

194
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,800
I've prepared the medicine, sir.

195
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,560
How are you feeling, sir?

196
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,280
Hey, you.

197
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,400
Let me ask you seriously.

198
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,000
Don’t mess around. No more jokes.

199
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,520
Where the hell is this place?

200
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,120
This is the residence
of Chao Phraya Singhanakhon,

201
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,920
Lord Aksakhet Prawetdao Damrongburirat.

202
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,840
Is that a person's name?

203
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,040
That’s your father's full name, sir.

204
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,040
He is the governor of Singhanakhon.

205
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,000
Don’t you remember anything at all, sir?

206
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,000
Singhanakhon...

207
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,920
And where in the country
of Saenya is this Singhanakhon?

208
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,800
The country of Saenya?

209
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,640
I’ve never heard of such a place, sir.

210
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,640
Singhanakhon is
in the Kingdom of Thanapura, sir.

211
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,440
Thanapura?

212
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,760
Thanapura...

213
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,600
A kingdom that existed
before the country of Saenya?

214
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,520
Our beloved Saenya...

215
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,400
...has existed for over 200 years now.

216
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,240
Since the day it was founded.

217
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,400
Mr. Pinyapat.

218
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,080
Yes?

219
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,200
Answer me.

220
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,400
Before it became Saenya,

221
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,920
what was this land called?

222
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,360
The Kingdom of Tempura.

223
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,600
Looks like it’s almost lunchtime.

224
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,240
You must be hungry.

225
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,360
Okay then, friends, tell me—

226
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,680
What kingdom was it?

227
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,640
- Thanapura!
- Thanapura!

228
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,600
Remember this—

229
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,000
Thanapura.

230
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,200
Not Tempura.

231
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,600
Now tell me—

232
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,800
Who was the last king
of the Thanawong dynasty

233
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,120
in the Kingdom of Thanapura?

234
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,760
What was his name?

235
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Chaiyached, sir.

236
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,560
The current reigning monarch...

237
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,280
...is King Chaiyached.

238
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,960
Oh my god.

239
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,160
Did I seriously just
travel back hundreds of years?

240
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
Guys.

241
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,560
Cover your ears.

242
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,960
Why cover our ears, sir?

243
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,920
I said cover your ears.

244
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,520
Sir.

245
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,080
Here’s your lime honey, sir.

246
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,040
Thanks, dear.

247
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Sir.

248
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,840
Please don’t overthink it.

249
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,240
It might be the medicine...

250
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,040
...messing with your thoughts.

251
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,440
Please eat something first.

252
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,640
Once you’re full,

253
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,600
your memory might come back.

254
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,280
Wow, that looks delicious.

255
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,520
So...

256
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,320
Where are the spoon and fork?

257
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,440
You usually eat with your hands, sir.

258
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,280
My hands?

259
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Like...

260
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,120
Grab sticky rice with my fingers?

261
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
You can give it a try.

262
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,520
Um, wait a second, sir.

263
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,800
You need to dip
your hand in this basin first.

264
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,200
If this wasn’t the past,

265
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,960
a hand touch like that—

266
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,280
It means someone’s into you.

267
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,040
Sir.

268
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,120
I do.

269
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,520
Alright then, I’m gonna eat now.

270
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,600
Um, that’s not how you do it, sir.

271
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,000
Please watch me, sir.

272
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,880
Allow me, sir.

273
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,120
Use three fingers.

274
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,600
Roll them into a circle.

275
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Like this, sir.

276
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,680
Okay, I’ll give it a try then.

277
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,080
Wait—hey, you.

278
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,280
Sit down first.

279
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Sit down.

280
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,400
We’ve been talking for ages,

281
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,120
but I still don’t know your name.

282
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,400
What’s your name?

283
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Uh...

284
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,000
It’s Jade, sir.

285
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,160
You don’t even remember my name, sir?

286
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,880
I don’t remember anything at all.

287
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,640
I don’t even know who I am.

288
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,480
Your name is Count Worradej Weerakitchamnan.

289
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,280
Just call you Count Worradej for short.

290
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,200
That name’s long and old-fashioned.

291
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,520
This medicine really is intense.

292
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,520
It wiped your memory clean, sir.

293
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,760
But it’s good you’re awake now.

294
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,280
Even if you can’t remember,
it’s better than being dead.

295
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,000
You know what, sir?

296
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,480
I almost cried myself to death.

297
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,160
Hey...

298
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,960
Since we’re here already—

299
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,160
What exactly happened?

300
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,120
So what kind of drug was it?

301
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,880
What did I take?

302
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,440
Lord Banjong said you were heartbroken.

303
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,200
So you took poison and died.

304
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,160
Count Kosol was the one who found you.

305
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,080
He brought your body back himself.

306
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,480
Heartbroken and decided to die?

307
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,280
Were you depressed, Worradej?

308
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,120
So who was I in love with?

309
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,520
No one knows, sir.

310
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,440
You never told anyone.

311
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,640
But everyone in town
gossips about one person.

312
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,040
Who?

313
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,720
Lord Kosol, sir.

314
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,800
They all say—

315
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,920
You and Lord Kosol...

316
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,360
Go on.

317
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,120
They say you and Lord Kosol
were lovers in secret.

318
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,800
That name—Lord Kosol—sounds familiar too.

319
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,040
If I meet him,

320
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,880
maybe I’ll find out what really happened.

321
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,360
And then...

322
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,960
Jade.

323
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,680
Take me to see Lord Kosol tomorrow.

324
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,640
This way, sir.

325
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,480
Jade?

326
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,440
Do I look pretty?

327
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,560
Very pretty, sir.

328
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,240
Isn’t this the way into the forest?

329
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,840
Yes, sir.

330
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,760
But we’re going to Lord Kosol’s house.

331
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
Yes, sir.

332
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,920
His house is in the forest.

333
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,600
A house or a bandit’s den?

334
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,080
Lord Kosol is a bit of an odd one.

335
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,920
- Doesn’t mix with people much.
- Thief!

336
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,800
Help! Someone catch the thief!

337
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,880
Help me, please! Catch him!

338
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,080
Help me catch him! Please!

339
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,080
Catch the thief! Somebody help!

340
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,360
You bastard!

341
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,160
It’s just one old cloth and you still steal it?

342
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,320
Give it back!

343
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,080
I’m sorry, sir.

344
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,640
I didn’t mean to do it.

345
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,120
Didn’t know you were someone important.

346
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,520
I truly apologize, sir.

347
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,440
Why are you apologizing to a thief?

348
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,920
Whether he's someone important or not,

349
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,960
stealing is still a crime.

350
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,360
You don’t need to apologize.

351
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,400
Call the police and have him arrested!

352
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,720
Who are you?

353
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,800
Why are you meddling?

354
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,160
If the owner won’t press charges,

355
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,000
why are you getting worked up?

356
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,400
You got your stuff back. Now scram.

357
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,560
Yes, sir.

358
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,280
Come back here, please.

359
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,440
Please, wait!

360
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,000
If anyone should be arrested, it’s you.

361
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,600
You tripped me and I fell.

362
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,520
That’s physical assault.

363
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,320
Sweetie,

364
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,360
where did you get all that confidence from?

365
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,200
You’re great at blaming others.

366
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,800
So you're completely innocent, huh?

367
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,360
Please don’t get into it, sir.

368
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,120
Judging by her clothes,

369
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,680
she’s probably of higher status.

370
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,480
Let’s just move on quickly.

371
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,440
Fine, I’ll go.

372
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,960
But staying here...

373
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,440
I might end up slapping someone bald.

374
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,160
Hey! Why are you following me?

375
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,800
Planning to rob me too?

376
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,720
Is this forest built by your father?

377
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,120
Why can’t I walk here?

378
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,880
I didn’t say you couldn’t.

379
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,480
Just don’t follow me, alright?

380
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,000
Who said I’m following you?

381
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,800
You’re the one following me.

382
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,240
Then just tell me which way you’re going.

383
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,920
I’ll walk in the opposite direction.

384
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,920
So we’re done and can split up.

385
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,200
I’m going to Lord Kosol’s house.

386
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,080
Do you know where that is?

387
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,960
Are you bringing your friend to rob me too?

388
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,800
They’re not with me. I’m not one of them!

389
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,680
Sir, this way.

390
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,480
Wait for me!

391
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,240
Help! Somebody help!

392
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,760
Please don’t hurt me.

393
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,640
I’m just a tiny little queer
who just rose from the dead.

394
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,480
There’s nothing worth stealing here.

395
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,800
Nothing at all.

396
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,960
Hey, you—

397
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,440
Your necklace, rings,
watch—just give them what they want.

398
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,560
You wanna die?

399
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,960
They’re not here for the bling.

400
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,040
They want blood.

401
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,240
If you want my life,
you’ll have to go through his first.

402
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,720
No one harms my master
without crossing my corpse.

403
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,360
Are you alright, sir?

404
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
I’m fine.

405
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,600
But, Jade—

406
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,880
Who was that guy?

407
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,160
That’s Lord Kosol, sir.

408
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,480
The one rumored to have deep ties with you.

409
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,960
Oh. My. God.

410
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,320
Girl, your man is so hot
I might just faint and die on the spot.

411
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,640
My Lord.

412
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,680
What are you doing here?

413
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,200
Are you not afraid of dying?

414
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,680
I came to see you, of course.

415
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,600
With you by my side,

416
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,000
no one can harm me.

417
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,960
Not even those petty little bandits.

418
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,240
And what about you?

419
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,040
Weren’t you supposed to be dead?

420
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,640
I rose from the dead...

421
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,040
just to come see you.

422
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,080
Why are the tributes from
the northern provinces so scarce?

423
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,840
Did you even check thoroughly?

424
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,040
But I’ve double-checked multiple times, sir.

425
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,520
Let go! Why am I being dragged here?

426
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,040
You’ll find out soon enough.

427
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,360
Didn’t I tell you to stay away from my son?

428
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,360
Now you come barging in like this—

429
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,080
Do you have no shame?

430
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,440
Or do you think your royal blood
makes you untouchable?

431
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,520
Your title was stripped long ago.

432
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,640
You’re nothing more than a commoner now.

433
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,880
Even as a commoner,

434
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,080
I’d still stand taller
than traitors like you.

435
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,200
How dare you!

436
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,880
Who are you calling a traitor?

437
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,640
Soldiers, arrest Kosol for treason.

438
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,800
Arrest him now!

439
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,800
Yeah, seriously.

440
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,280
Who exactly...

441
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,440
is the real traitor here?

442
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,400
The one who ambushed me in the forest?

443
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,240
King Chaiyached.

444
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,440
Don’t tell me this spoiled brat—

445
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,320
is actually King Chaiyached?

446
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,840
The last monarch of Thanapura?

447
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,120
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

448
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,200
I wasn’t aware Your Majesty
would arrive earlier than planned.

449
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,920
So I failed to prepare a proper welcome.

450
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,360
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

451
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,440
Forget that matter.

452
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,520
Let’s focus on the fact
that someone tried to assassinate me.

453
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,320
It happened in your city.

454
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,920
Do you have any clues
about who was behind it?

455
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,120
In my territory,

456
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,000
there’s no place for
traitors or bandits to hide.

457
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,120
Except perhaps...

458
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,600
Kosol’s residence.

459
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,720
Out near the edge of the forest.

460
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,400
He’s never let officials enter
and search it, Your Majesty.

461
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,440
This sword belonged to the bandits.

462
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,120
It bears the insignia of Singha City’s army.

463
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,920
And yet you still dare accuse me?

464
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,960
Many of my men’s swords
were stolen and sold on the black market.

465
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,480
With just this little proof,

466
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,760
you intend to incriminate me?

467
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,080
And what about you?

468
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,920
What were you doing at the crime scene?

469
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,480
Weren’t you the one
who led the bandits there?

470
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,320
Worradej.

471
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,000
Tell your father.

472
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,520
Who was the one that saved
Chaiyached from the bandits?

473
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,560
Answer.

474
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,280
It was you, of course.

475
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,920
Fierce and fearless.

476
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,280
Took out every bandit alone.

477
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,480
Then why didn’t you leave at least one alive?

478
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,440
We could’ve interrogated them
to find out who gave the order.

479
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,320
Or was it because...

480
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,440
you wanted to silence them?

481
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,320
Worradej, tell His Majesty,

482
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,960
that Kosol...

483
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,560
is the one who conspired against the throne.

484
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,440
Lord Kosol.

485
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,400
That’s a name everyone better remember.

486
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,200
He’s the half-brother of King Chaiyached.

487
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,480
He’s ruthless to the core.

488
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,400
Ambitious as hell too.

489
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,000
So tell me—

490
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,640
what chaos did he stir up?

491
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,040
If the teacher’s saying this much,

492
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,200
he must've killed his own brother.

493
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,120
To crown himself King, right?

494
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,520
Exactly.

495
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,560
But before Lord Kosol could steal the throne—

496
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,560
King Saenyakorn gathered his forces

497
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,760
to crush the rebel Lord Kosol.

498
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,000
And then he crowned himself king.

499
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,640
The very first of the Saenya dynasty.

500
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,240
He changed the name of this land—

501
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,040
and called it Saenya ever since.

502
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,600
Wait... am I living through
a major historical moment?

503
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,960
If I say Kosol was behind the attack...

504
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,360
and he gets arrested—

505
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,280
then King Chaiyached keeps ruling.

506
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,520
Which means...

507
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,000
the country of Saenya might never exist.

508
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,800
Should I just shut up
and let history run its course?

509
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,920
Or speak up and change everything?

510
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,080
Worradej.

511
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,760
Why won’t you speak?

512
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,720
Tell us what you know about your father.

513
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,040
Is he a traitor?

514
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,840
Can you not pressure me right now?

515
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,520
I need to talk to myself first.

516
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,080
If I know Kosol’s
planning to kill his brother...

517
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,720
shouldn’t I speak up?

518
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,040
I should do what’s right, shouldn’t I?

519
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,400
But if I tell them...

520
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,520
That would totally rewrite history!

521
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,800
Ugh, my head’s spinning.

522
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,080
Time’s up.

523
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,800
Tell everyone who the real traitor is.

524
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,040
Lord Kosol is the traitor.

525
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,400
He plotted to assassinate King Chaiyached

526
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,120
and steal the throne for himself.

527
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,480
Soldiers, seize Lord Kosol.

528
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,920
Wait.

529
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,520
Worradej just came back from the dead.

530
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,840
His mind might not be stable yet.

531
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,240
I suggest...

532
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,600
we postpone the verdict.

533
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
But Your Majesty—

534
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,800
I'm leaving.

535
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Your Majesty!

536
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,640
This is a matter of life and death!

537
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,000
Your Majesty!

538
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,000
Let me go— ow!

539
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,320
Hey! Where are you dragging me?

540
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,680
Let go!

541
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
Come here!

542
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,800
- Let me go!
- Big bro!

543
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,520
Can I stay at your place tonight?

544
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,800
You’re a king.

545
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,080
How can you stay at
a lowborn’s shack like mine?

546
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,720
Go stay at the Singhapiman Palace.

547
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,400
Nah.

548
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,400
The palace is boring.
Being with you is way more fun.

549
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,360
Haven’t seen me in forever— didn’t you miss me?

550
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
No.

551
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,560
Aw, why so cold-hearted?

552
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,360
Whatever, I’m still crashing
at your place tonight.

553
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,680
You’re just scared
of getting ambushed again.

554
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,680
Just admit it already.

555
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,360
I know exactly how you think.

556
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,080
Then why even ask?

557
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,720
Worradej.

558
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,080
Where are you taking me?

559
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,400
Big bro!

560
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,920
Big bro...

561
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,800
Careful, would you?

562
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,840
I’m tiny—why so rough with me?

563
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,520
You’ve been way mouthier
since coming back to life.

564
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,080
Wanna die again or what?

565
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,080
No, please!

566
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,120
I don’t wanna die yet.

567
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,360
Then shut your mouth.

568
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,280
You guys, go find some food
and water for my brother.

569
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,520
You’ll be staying here with me.

570
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,040
No titles, no royal status.

571
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,120
Can you handle that?

572
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,240
Of course.

573
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,080
I’m not obsessed with titles anyway.

574
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Good.

575
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,840
Then wait for me here.

576
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,760
I’ve got something
to settle with this guy first.

577
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
Big bro—

578
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,000
Don’t take too long, I’ll be waiting.

579
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,440
If you’re gonna kill me, go ahead.

580
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,640
I could never beat you anyway.

581
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,800
But...

582
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,360
Please make sure I die looking pretty.

583
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,120
Help!

584
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,280
Help!

585
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,520
What the—

586
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,840
Help me!

587
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,680
You were never scared of my pet before.

588
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
Moo Moo.

589
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,960
Go outside for now.

590
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,679
What kinda tiger is named Moo Moo?

591
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,400
What planet am I even on?

592
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,320
Worradej.

593
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,000
What is going on with you?

594
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,040
Why have you changed so much?

595
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,080
You’re nothing like the person I knew.

596
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,760
I’m still the same old me.

597
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,080
Maybe it’s the poison.

598
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,159
Wasn’t it you

599
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,800
who broke my heart

600
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,679
and made me take poison to die?

601
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,120
Me? I broke your heart?

602
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,280
The day I left for the port city,

603
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,000
we were still on good terms.

604
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,639
But when I came back,

605
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,920
I heard you’d already taken poison.

606
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,120
I seriously doubt it was because of me.

607
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,600
Wait—

608
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,080
So Worradej didn’t die from heartbreak?

609
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,600
Was it because of that Kosol guy?

610
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,480
So Kosol wasn’t Worradej’s lover after all.

611
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,800
But what confuses me more is—

612
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,280
why are you suddenly accusing me

613
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,080
of killing Chaiyached?

614
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,560
Didn’t we agree already

615
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,640
that we’d overthrow him

616
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,480
but not kill him?

617
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,480
Oh my god.

618
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,520
So she actually conspired
with Kosol to start a rebellion?

619
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,720
Why are you quiet now?

620
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,840
Talking to yourself again?

621
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,920
Well, um...

622
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,480
I’ve been kind of spaced out lately.

623
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,000
I can’t really remember anything.

624
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,720
Give me a sec to process all this.

625
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,200
Tell me—

626
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,760
what are you really plotting?

627
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,480
Why are you accusing me?

628
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,600
I’m sorry.

629
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,760
I’m just really confused right now.

630
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,840
Please don’t hurt me.

631
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,160
Please.

632
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,280
Then let me help jog your memory.

633
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,560
Well? Starting to remember anything yet?

634
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,120
Tell me—

635
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,000
what exactly are you planning, Worradej?

636
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,680
Still can’t really remember.

637
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,400
Go ahead then, Kosol.

638
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,760
Still playing tough?

639
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,080
Let me see what I can do.

640
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,440
Let’s see if this softens
that mouth of yours.

641
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,880
Who's that?

642
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,040
It’s me.

643
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,680
What are you doing, bro?

644
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,240
I’m handling some business.

645
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,640
Wait for me.

646
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,680
I’ll come find you once I’m done.

647
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,840
Nope.

648
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,920
I’m bored.

649
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,840
Why are you always so busy talking?

650
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,320
Can I join in?

651
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,360
No.

652
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,800
Don’t even think about it.

653
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,640
Then you come talk to me.

654
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,120
Come on, now.

655
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,600
- Come on
- Alright, alright.

656
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,400
I’m coming, hold on.

657
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,240
If you try to escape—

658
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,400
Moo Moo will drag you back to me.

659
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,840
Between my fangs and Moomoo’s—

660
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,040
you better choose wisely.

661
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,320
Four moods in three minutes.

662
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,600
Is he insane or just misunderstood?

663
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,960
Ugh.

664
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,400
Don’t.

665
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,400
How many times do I have to tell you—

666
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,840
don’t play with fire.

667
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,880
Still scary as ever, bro.

668
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,840
You really came all
the way here to find me?

669
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,440
Then spit it out already.

670
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,200
If it's nonsense, I'm sending you back.

671
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,040
Since I ascended the throne—

672
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,720
and pardoned you out of prison—

673
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,600
it’s been almost a year now.

674
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,080
I just wanted to visit you as a brother would. That’s all.

675
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,960
Are we really that close?

676
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,720
Cause I don’t remember that.

677
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,680
Well, if you’ve visited me already,

678
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,480
then you can go back now.

679
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,440
Wait, there’s one more thing.

680
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,960
I want you to be my royal bodyguard again.

681
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,680
I’ll restore your title
and name you Chao Phraya.

682
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,600
Are you interested?

683
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,160
No.

684
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,560
I’m not.

685
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,400
I’ve got important business here.

686
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,160
Important business...

687
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,160
Like taking my throne?

688
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,400
So you already know.

689
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,360
You act like a child—

690
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,280
but I didn’t think
your thoughts were childish too.

691
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,560
Trying to recruit your rival to be your guard?

692
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,440
Is that what you’re doing?

693
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,480
I thought maybe giving you a grand title—

694
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,400
you’d give up the plan.

695
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,400
But I never thought—

696
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,400
you’d be this power-hungry.

697
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,600
Tell me honestly—

698
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,600
if you got my throne...

699
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,280
Would you kill me for it?

700
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,080
Hard to say.

701
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,240
Guess it depends on the moment.

702
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,760
Go stay at the Singhapiman Palace.

703
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,840
If you stay here,
I might just kill you in my sleep.

704
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,600
You two.

705
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,480
Keep an eye on my brother.

706
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,240
While he’s in Singhanakhon,
don’t let him out of your sight.

707
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,360
Protect him.
Don’t let anyone lay a finger on him.

708
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,480
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

709
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,200
Moomoo, you did well.

710
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,120
I’ll reward you later.

711
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,720
Moomoo, where did Worradej go?

712
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,920
We can’t sit around waiting
for that psycho to come back.

713
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,920
We need to run.

714
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,720
Run, Prince.

715
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,080
Run!

716
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,400
This is insane.

717
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,840
Of all things to raise—

718
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,520
he raises a tiger!

719
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,160
No idea who that is—

720
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,120
but it’s a man calling.

721
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,480
Better go for now.

722
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,160
A...

723
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,880
H...

724
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,320
W...

725
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,720
Hello, Officer.

726
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,440
Hello, Miss Nat.

727
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,040
You’re the manager—

728
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,000
of Mr. Pinyapat,
the singer who goes by Prince, correct?

729
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,000
Yes. And…

730
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,600
Has the doctor spoken to the doctor yet?

731
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,320
Actually, I'm not here about that.

732
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,960
Here.

733
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,080
This is a fine notice for Mr. Pinyapat

734
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,000
for presenting a gender identity
not matching his birth sex

735
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,000
on last night’s “Sanya Tonight” show.

736
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,440
Please sign on his behalf.

737
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,400
What about the case
where Prince got drugged?

738
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,040
Please sign the document.

739
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,400
Um…

740
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,960
Yes?

741
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,760
Wait, officer.

742
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,560
– Yes?
– What about the case?

743
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,600
That’ll have to be
transferred to another unit.

744
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,840
I’ll be straight with you.

745
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,440
The escort Prince hired that night

746
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,960
was working illegally.

747
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,280
Once things went down, they all ran off.

748
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,480
Now there’s no evidence left.

749
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,200
Tracking them down will be tough.

750
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,760
And Prince has a lot of haters too.

751
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,520
If he wants to go against his gender,

752
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,800
then he has to deal with it.

753
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,120
Excuse me.

754
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,240
Hey, you.

755
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,320
Where are we going?

756
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,040
Taking you home, of course.

757
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,800
Hurry and get on the boat.

758
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,880
Wait—hey, wait a sec!

759
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,800
And who even are you?

760
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,440
How do you know where I live?

761
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,960
Why are you helping me?

762
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,440
And how do I know I can trust you?

763
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,240
What if you’re some criminal

764
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,320
trying to kidnap me
or sell me off to a brothel?

765
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,320
Do I really look like someone who’d do that?

766
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,400
I’ll explain later.

767
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,320
For now, we have to run.

768
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,520
If Kosol’s tiger picks up
our scent, we’re done.

769
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,680
Just now, when you landed on me

770
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,080
and shouted “A.H.W.”—

771
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,720
What does that mean?

772
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,680
Oh…

773
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,240
It’s nothing.

774
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,800
I was just… rambling.

775
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,120
It just slipped out. Don’t mind it.

776
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,200
Even if it slipped out,

777
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,520
it must’ve meant something.

778
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,280
Is it some kind of abbreviation
or secret code?

779
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Well…

780
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,760
It stands for…

781
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,680
“Oh-ho, glasses.”

782
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,840
Oh-ho, glasses.

783
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,280
I saw your glasses
and it just came out.

784
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,720
Total reflex.

785
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,440
You’re the sun,

786
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,080
I’m the moon,

787
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,720
across the vast sky—

788
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,840
in the light of day.

789
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,880
I shine bright, you drift away.

790
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,760
When I fade, then you appear
to light the night.

791
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,320
It’s always been this way—

792
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,200
never changing,

793
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,200
endlessly repeating.

794
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,200
Wow, that’s gorgeous.

795
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,800
Whose poem is that?

796
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,240
No one’s.

797
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,200
Just...

798
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,040
a little verse by a humble poet.

799
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,600
Actually—

800
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,240
I worked with your father for quite a while.

801
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,880
You and I knew each other well.

802
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,480
You really don’t remember anything about me?

803
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,120
Really?

804
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,240
We’ve known each other for that long?

805
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,240
I’m sorry.

806
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,080
I’m the worst.

807
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,680
I drank some kind of poison—

808
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,120
then I passed out.

809
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,280
When I woke up, all my memories were gone.

810
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,160
Do you remember why

811
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,160
you took the poison in the first place?

812
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,640
Jade told me—

813
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,200
I was heartbroken.

814
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,200
So I tried to end my life.

815
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,120
And then some...

816
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,920
Some official or something—

817
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,000
found my body and brought it back home.

818
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,320
That was Banjong.

819
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,000
Yes, Banjong!

820
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,560
How did you know?

821
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,520
It was me.

822
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,320
Banjong.

823
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,640
Royal Scribe of Calligraphy.

824
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,240
Whoa.

825
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,800
So you were the one who found me.

826
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,440
Then tell me—

827
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,000
Worradej’s lover...

828
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,560
The one I was in love with—who was it?

829
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,400
Who broke my heart?

830
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,560
I really don’t know.

831
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,280
All I know is you were devastated by love.

832
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,280
Then tell me...

833
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,400
Before I died,

834
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,080
did I say anything? Any last words?

835
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,320
When I found you...

836
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,560
you were already gone.

837
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,840
This sucks.

838
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,080
Was it really true?

839
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,200
Or do you actually know
more than you're letting on?

840
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,000
And just not telling me?

841
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,560
Come on—

842
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,000
Why would I lie to you?

843
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,040
Honestly...

844
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,440
you don’t seem like the lying type.

845
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,440
You’ve got this innocent face.

846
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,960
I doubt you could fool anyone.

847
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,200
But...

848
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,760
seeing your face up close like this—

849
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,040
your face is...

850
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,960
seriously heaven-sent.

851
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,320
Jade, do you know what kind
of relationship I had with Banjong?

852
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,960
Total mess.

853
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,080
That letter—Banjong definitely
wrote it for Worradej.

854
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,520
Wait, do we have
two boyfriends now, Worradej?

855
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,080
While I’m on the run—

856
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,040
you’ll have to stay here as my hostage.

857
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,680
Kosol, isn’t he adorable?

858
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,400
Can I keep him?

859
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,240
You're always forcing people
to do what you want.

860
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,240
You think the whole world
revolves around you or what?

861
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,480
What just hit my leg?

862
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,000
That’s my giant snakehead fish.

863
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,360
Kosol.

864
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,200
Can I play with the baby for a bit?

865
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,720
Wait… is that a person’s name?

866
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,960
(Probably, Mom.)

867
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,040
What the—

868
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,800
- Why didn’t you say anything?
- Why didn’t you?

869
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,920
(I thought you were asking him.)

870
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,640
That scared me for real.

871
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,480
- Just stay still for a sec.
- Stay still, baby.

872
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,680
I’ll help you get your memory back.

873
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,280
Take it slow.
(This is off-script.)

874
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,160
(This is off-script.)

875
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,520
Why are you using that big fan?

876
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,600
The small one would’ve worked.

877
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,360
- But I’m hot.
- I’m hot too.

878
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,760
I’m the hottest of all.
