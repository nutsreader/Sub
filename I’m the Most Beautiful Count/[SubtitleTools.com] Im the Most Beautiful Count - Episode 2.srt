1
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,770
I'm being serious.

2
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,480
Where exactly am I?

3
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,060
You woke up raving mad, huh?

4
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,600
Might as well have stayed dead.

5
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,990
Jade, who was that man?

6
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,240
That’s Lord Kosol, sir.

7
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,479
The one rumored to be close with the Count.

8
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,660
My dear brother...

9
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,039
Why have you changed so much?

10
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,100
You're not the man I used to know.

11
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,710
Then let me help jog your memory.

12
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,330
So you're the one who found my body.

13
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,880
Then tell me…who was the one I loved?

14
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,630
And who was the one who broke my heart?

15
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,430
If you know anything about me,

16
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,190
you need to tell me right now.

17
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,120
Of course.

18
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,260
I want to know who my true love was.

19
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,580
And finally find out

20
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,200
what really happened to me.

21
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,190
If I remember anything,
I’ll tell you right away.

22
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:24,440
For now, please get back on the boat.

23
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,960
If the Lord sees you,
we’ll be in trouble.

24
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,829
Then I’ll go for now. See you soon.

25
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,440
Row carefully.

26
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,829
That guy with the glasses...

27
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,760
Feels like he's hiding something.

28
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,210
Or maybe it’s him…

29
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,540
maybe he’s the one dating Worradej.

30
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,710
Banjong.

31
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,800
Worradej.

32
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,430
What do you think you're doing?

33
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,480
Oh, please.

34
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,310
That was nothing
compared to what you just did.

35
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,400
If someone had seen us...

36
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,270
we could’ve been jailed.

37
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,260
For expressing a gender identity
that doesn't match our birth sex.

38
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,380
You know the law better than anyone.

39
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,870
Huh?

40
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,210
Just two men kissing on the cheek...

41
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,480
and we’d get thrown in jail?

42
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,120
I thought it’d just be a fine or something.

43
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,870
An offense this serious…

44
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,210
it means prison, no exceptions.

45
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,940
Besides, we’re just friends, nothing more.

46
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,490
You can't show affection like that toward me.

47
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,920
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,200
I was only messing with you, that’s all.

49
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,800
Don’t be mad at me, Banjong.

50
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:38,540
Please?

51
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,730
Just don’t do that again, alright?

52
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,910
Alrighty.

53
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,650
I’m heading off.

54
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,690
Alright then.

55
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,030
Wait, so they’re not dating?

56
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,000
Then that means...

57
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,800
Worradej’s boyfriend...

58
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,310
is that creepy Kosol guy?

59
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,880
Ugh, how could anyone like him?

60
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,660
He’s terrifying.

61
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,340
As of now...

62
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,400
someone is secretly trying to kill me.

63
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,760
And I know...

64
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,870
they're hiding among you.

65
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,649
If anyone has a lead,
report to me at once.

66
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,310
And if that person is listening…
drop your plan now.

67
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,710
Because if I bleed even a single drop...

68
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,190
my brother Kosol

69
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,040
will cut your head off on the spot.

70
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,200
Just like that petty thief
who died in the woods yesterday.

71
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,400
But if you all take good care of me,

72
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,300
I’ll reward every one
of you with a little bonus.

73
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,600
My Lord.

74
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,240
What are you looking for, sir?

75
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,890
You’ve been searching forever.

76
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,590
I’m just poking around, really.

77
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,080
Hoping I might find something
about the one I loved.

78
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,590
And yesterday when Kosol kidnapped you

79
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,300
did you get anything out of it, sir?

80
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,180
Kosol said he had no real issue with me.

81
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,880
So that can't be
the reason I tried to end my life.

82
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,220
Now that I know that...
I’m even more confused.

83
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,430
You’re the sun,
I’m the moon, in the vast sky.

84
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,970
In the day, I shine while you drift away.

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,470
When I fade,
you return to light the night.

86
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,970
And so it goes, unchanged, for all time.

87
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,690
Jade.

88
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,760
Do you know what kind of relationship
I had with Lord Banjong?

89
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,520
You and Lord Banjong...

90
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,010
worked for the Lord together for years.

91
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,990
You two were quite close, sir.

92
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,700
Why do you ask?

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,330
Well, this poem…

94
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,520
Banjong recited it to me last night.

95
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,190
And when I looked like
I didn’t remember it,

96
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,920
he seemed kinda sulky.

97
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,950
Then I found the same poem in this drawer.

98
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,530
So I think...

99
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,760
this must be a love letter
Banjong wrote to me.

100
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,920
I kinda wanna know...

101
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,360
Lord Banjong being your lover...

102
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,810
I honestly never saw that coming, sir.

103
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,030
Jade.

104
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,510
Take me to Lord Banjong’s house, please.

105
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,180
Worradej.

106
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,120
Worradej, you bastard.

107
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,450
Is Worradej in his room?

108
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,980
No, sir. He’s not.

109
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,090
Then where did he go?

110
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,200
I truly don’t know, sir.

111
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,500
Tch…damn it.

112
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,550
How can you not know where your master is?

113
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,990
You want a whipping?

114
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,300
No, sir.

115
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,000
I really haven’t seen him.

116
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,230
I’m out looking for him too, sir.

117
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,580
You lying to me?

118
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,600
Where are you off to, sir?

119
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,410
Your Lordship, he’s not in his room.

120
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,210
Out of my way.

121
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,400
If you find him,

122
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,050
tell him to get his ass back
and help me work.

123
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,810
Do something useful for once.

124
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,270
So the villagers stop
talking crap behind his back.

125
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,920
Yes, Your Lordship.

126
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,900
Oh, and tell him one more thing…

127
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,380
tone down the whole queen act.

128
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,890
Or I’ll beat it out of him myself.

129
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,230
Yes, sir.

130
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,010
Sir.

131
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,390
Are you... really okay?

132
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,320
Here it is…Lord Banjong’s residence.

133
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,880
- Let’s just go inside.
- Uh...

134
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,320
Maybe we should call out first, sir.

135
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,200
If you barge in uninvited,

136
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,670
he might think we’re burglars.

137
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,760
Wait.

138
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,200
Let’s just go in.

139
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,220
We might find something good.

140
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,430
Jade.

141
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,000
Do those two know each other?

142
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,130
It’s my first time seeing them together, sir.

143
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,590
That’s real strange.

144
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,440
The Count’s basically top-tier nobility.

145
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,450
And Kosol’s basically
one step from being a criminal.

146
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,750
How the hell did those two get close?

147
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,860
Let’s move in a little closer.

148
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,630
Can’t hear a thing from here.

149
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,260
What are you two up to?

150
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,930
Is anyone home?

151
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,600
I’m here to see Lord Banjong, that’s all.

152
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,640
I wasn’t eavesdropping.

153
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,290
The door was already open...

154
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,550
so I just walked in, that’s all.

155
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,920
Then I saw the two of you talking,

156
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,940
so I just stood here waiting.

157
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,600
I caught you red-handed eavesdropping…

158
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,860
and you’re still making excuses?

159
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,040
I’m not making excuses.

160
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,190
I’m just explaining what happened.

161
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,390
Don’t push my patience.

162
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,450
You still owe me one case.

163
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,710
Who gave you permission
to escape last night?

164
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,340
I haven’t even finished interrogating you.

165
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,280
And who gave you permission to lock me up?

166
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,910
If you didn’t wait for me to allow it,

167
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,570
then I don’t need
your permission to escape either.

168
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,660
You dare talk back to me now, Worradej?

169
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,510
Damn right I do, Kosol.

170
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,680
Enough.

171
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,870
Stop bickering over nonsense.

172
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,280
Worradej.

173
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,990
So why did you come to see me?

174
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,920
Whatever it is, say it now.

175
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,680
Well...

176
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,420
I’d like to stay at your place,
Lord Banjong.

177
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,550
What for?

178
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,600
Your house is huge
why come live in mine?

179
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,360
And who’s this?

180
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,720
I’m Pandao, Lord Banjong’s sister.

181
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,800
I heard your memory’s not
what it used to be,

182
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,630
but I didn’t think it was this bad.

183
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,020
You should remember me
in your next life, even.

184
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,200
Pandao...

185
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,490
How many times have I said…

186
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,230
don’t say nonsense like that.

187
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,150
So why do you need to stay here?

188
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,710
Is there a reason?

189
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,360
I asked to stay here...

190
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,390
because I’m scared of
the Lord’s scolding.

191
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,790
And do you think that’s a valid reason?

192
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,230
Valid or not…I don’t care.

193
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,780
But you have to let Worradej stay here.

194
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,640
But Worradej once betrayed our group.

195
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,590
He killed one of our own.

196
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,880
If we let him in...

197
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,750
he could be a threat
to our operation, Kosol.

198
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,160
But right now Worradej remembers nothing.

199
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,800
We just have to slowly feed
his memories back.

200
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,630
And once he becomes someone new...

201
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,590
then he can help us with our cause.

202
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,180
But I still don’t trust him.

203
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,390
When he saw me,

204
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,030
he accidentally blurted out “A.H.W.”

205
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,170
Sounds like some kind of secret code.

206
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,130
I’m telling you…he’s definitely
hiding something from us.

207
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,640
Worradej is faking the amnesia.

208
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,370
He’s here to destroy us from within.

209
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,020
That Worradej is gone.

210
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,570
And I believe he’d never do that again.

211
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,640
I won’t lose another comrade

212
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,540
because of that man ever again.

213
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:32,200
So will you let Worradej stay
at your house or not?

214
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,140
No. I won’t allow it.

215
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,680
Allow it or not...

216
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,710
Fine. I’ll allow it. Happy?

217
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,450
And let me be very clear…

218
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,050
Worradej is mine.

219
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,180
Don’t you dare pull the same stunt again.

220
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,840
Or your fate will be
no different from the last.

221
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,640
Are we clear?

222
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,190
Fine. We’re clear.

223
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,120
What’s with the “fine”?

224
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,810
Okay okay! I got it.

225
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,580
I understand everything now.

226
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,900
From now on,
I won’t lay a finger on Worradej.

227
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,030
- Is it pretty?
- Nope.

228
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,650
Wow, brutal comment.

229
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,420
Hey, Pandao.

230
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,460
You and I were probably besties, right?

231
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,530
I probably came to see you every day.

232
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,370
And we’d gossip like gal pals do.

233
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,600
Yeah, you came here every single day.

234
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,620
And I kicked you out every single day.

235
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,770
Maybe I stayed gossiping till late

236
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,360
so you worried I’d struggle getting home?

237
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,850
Nope. I was just annoyed by you.

238
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,240
I hated how you were
always clinging to my brother.

239
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,550
So I came to see Banjong every day?

240
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,250
Then what exactly was I to him?

241
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,750
Worradej...

242
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,550
Banjong said you can stay here.

243
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,320
Really?

244
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,680
No way! I won’t allow it!

245
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,250
Enough, Pandao. It’s alright.

246
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,410
Worradej, you’re welcome
to stay here as long as you like.

247
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,380
Thanks, Banjong.

248
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,680
- Ow!
- Ah!

249
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,860
Sir, you’re really not
letting me stay with you?

250
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,150
Then who’s gonna feed you?

251
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,970
I’ll prep your bath, lay out your clothes…

252
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,500
please let me stay and serve you, sir.

253
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,840
Please, sir.

254
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,200
Jade.

255
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,170
I’m not the same person anymore.

256
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,110
You don’t have to wait
on me hand and foot now.

257
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,600
Use your time to keep an eye on Father.

258
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,510
Don’t let him find out I’ve snuck off here.

259
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,130
I have to investigate...

260
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,810
how I actually died.

261
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,190
And once I’ve solved this whole mess,

262
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,820
I’ll finally be able to go home.

263
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,780
Then I’ll be waiting, sir.

264
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,790
(Register of Conscripts,
by Chao Phraya Singhanakhon)

265
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,360
It’s exactly the same.

266
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,250
Like, spot-on.

267
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,590
Banjong totally wrote
this love letter for that Worradej.

268
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,930
Oh my god.

269
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,390
Girl, does this mean
you’ve got two boyfriends?

270
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,600
Oh my god.

271
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,070
Worradej.

272
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,890
Where are you?

273
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,510
Worradej?

274
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,630
Worradej!

275
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,000
What are you doing in Banjong’s office?

276
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,030
You’re living here now…

277
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,470
you can’t just wander around aimlessly.

278
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,210
I was just lost, alright?

279
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,800
It’s literally my first day here.

280
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,020
I'm so confused already.

281
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,190
This isn’t your first day here.

282
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,160
You’ve been here a hundred times.

283
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,880
Oh please...

284
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,210
Don’t scold me, darling.

285
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,550
Anyway, what brings you to me?
Business or...?

286
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,550
Or did you miss me?

287
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,150
I saw you moved in here,

288
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,190
but didn’t bring any of your stuff.

289
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,940
So I thought I’d take you to the market.

290
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,620
Get you some new things.

291
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,850
Really? Let’s go, let’s go!

292
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,230
I love shopping!

293
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,430
Love what?

294
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,240
Shopping.

295
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,890
Come on!

296
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,470
Hurry!

297
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:52,920
Right this way!

298
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,680
- Take a look!
- Go ahead!

299
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,810
- Come, come!
- Want some limes?

300
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,710
Buy one, get one free!

301
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,090
Silk trousers! Trousers here!

302
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,250
Great fabric, too!

303
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:06,780
Bracelets, darling! Pretty bangles!

304
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:16,140
I looked around for you.

305
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,079
No such thing as "shopping" like you said.

306
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:20,550
Just grilled chicken. Want some?

307
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,230
It’s fine.

308
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,530
Hey, Kosol…

309
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,260
don’t you feel something... off?

310
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,120
I feel like…

311
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,500
people at the market
are giving us weird looks.

312
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,320
You want one, dear? Hurry!

313
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,250
Of course they are. They know about us.

314
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,450
The Count, son of the governor,

315
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,550
fooling around with a filthy ex-con.

316
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,820
Nothing makes better gossip
than the two of us.

317
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,150
What are you doing?

318
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,290
If they’re gonna talk anyway,

319
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,270
I might as well give them
something juicier to talk about.

320
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,270
Let it be scandalous.

321
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,690
Wait.

322
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,980
Let me ask you something.

323
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,990
What’s your name?

324
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,430
Huh?

325
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,780
My name’s Worradej. Obviously.

326
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,180
What’s wrong with you?

327
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,600
Sudden memory loss or something?

328
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,180
Forgetting my name, seriously?

329
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,460
I’m just not used to it.

330
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,760
You never used to be this cheeky before.

331
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,960
It’s like ever since you drank that poison,

332
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,580
another spirit’s taken over your body.

333
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,190
Wow, your imagination…

334
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,910
it’s kinda next level.

335
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,980
I’m still the same old Worradej.

336
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,330
Just with extra sass now.

337
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,580
You like it?

338
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,590
Hey! Don’t walk away…answer me first.

339
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,000
Do you like it or not?

340
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,740
Kosol.

341
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,490
If you like it, just say so.

342
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,480
I don’t get why you’d let
Worradej stay with us again.

343
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,080
Aren’t you afraid he’ll stir up
trouble in our group?

344
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,250
Or are you scared of Lord Kosol?

345
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,070
Did he threaten you?

346
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,110
Me? Afraid of Kosol?

347
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,360
Not a chance.

348
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,150
If he tries anything,

349
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,590
I can fight back just fine.

350
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,750
But the reason I gave in…

351
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,640
Because I want Worradej
where we can see him.

352
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,880
If he plans anything shady again,

353
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,610
we’ll shut him down fast.

354
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,910
Is that so?

355
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,210
Exactly.

356
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,090
Could you go easy?

357
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,370
So what happened to your arm?

358
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,790
Did Lord Kosol twist it or something?

359
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,410
No.

360
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,690
If he had done that to me,

361
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,630
I’d have punched him right back by now.

362
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,210
It’s just...

363
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,760
I stretched wrong when I was yawning.

364
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,740
Keep massaging, please.

365
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,150
So damn good.

366
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,990
Auntie, how much for
these khanom krok?

367
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,760
Eight pairs for half a pai.

368
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,240
Then I’ll take half a pai, please.

369
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,600
Not selling.

370
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,830
Alright, just one pai it is.

371
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,890
No matter how many pai, I’m not selling.

372
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,640
I won’t sell to perverts.
I don’t wanna end up in jail too.

373
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,340
Are you gonna sell or not?

374
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,820
No.

375
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,370
Then I guess I’ll just smash
all your stuff to bits.

376
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,360
Oh…okay!

377
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,330
I’ll sell! I’ll sell!

378
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,240
Let me grab it for you right now.

379
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,530
Listen up, all vendors.

380
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,610
If I visit your shop…

381
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,600
and you refuse to sell to me,

382
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,180
then get ready to carry the rubble home.

383
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,420
So scary.

384
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,300
Kosol...

385
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,680
This kind of behavior won’t help us.

386
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,430
It’s only going to make
the villagers hate us even more.

387
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,120
I never asked anyone to love me.

388
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,750
Why are you like this?

389
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,310
Now watch me.

390
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,070
Dear vendors, every single one of you…

391
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,020
whatever you brought today...

392
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,400
I’ll buy it all.

393
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,770
Here’s the money.

394
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,610
I, Count Worradej,

395
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,330
have enough to pay for every single shop.

396
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,460
And to all the lovely people
shopping here today…

397
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,860
keep your money in your pockets.

398
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,710
I’ll cover everything for you.

399
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,300
I’m footing the bill today.

400
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,850
- Careful, it’s hot!
- Thanks, love!

401
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,870
Auntie, those khanom krok…

402
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,960
keep making them till you run out, okay?

403
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,400
Just tell me how much when you're done.

404
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,430
Alright, everyone!

405
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,380
If you want khanom krok,
come get them!

406
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,960
Hurry up!

407
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,760
They’ll be gone before you know it!

408
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,960
See? Winning people over…

409
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,500
is actually super easy.

410
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,750
From now on,

411
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,670
everyone’s gonna talk about this moment.

412
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,850
It’ll spread through the whole village.

413
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,000
And our reputation…

414
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,750
will turn from bad to fabulous.

415
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,620
Genius, right?

416
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,100
Where did you even get the money

417
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,390
to buy out the entire market?

418
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,490
It’s my own money!

419
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,380
Been saving it for years…never used it.

420
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,500
Wow, Jade!

421
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,270
Am I seriously rich enough
to have a chest of coins?

422
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,430
The Lord gave it for you to spend, sir.

423
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,180
But you never touched it…
not for all these years.

424
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,890
And why didn’t I use it?

425
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,000
Was I... stingy or something?

426
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,610
Or was I saving it for something?

427
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,110
You weren’t stingy, sir.

428
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,140
And you weren’t saving up
for anything either.

429
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,800
That money came from the Lord...

430
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:06,070
squeezed out of the villagers.

431
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,690
You said you couldn’t
bring yourself to use it.

432
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,370
But I found a way to put it back into use…

433
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,580
to help the people he took it from.

434
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,290
You should try being nice to them for once.

435
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,890
With that scowl,
no one wants to come near you.

436
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,700
Except you, apparently.

437
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,990
The snacks are for eating…
my hand is not.

438
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,750
What?

439
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,080
No, you can’t.

440
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,860
Worradej, you bastard!

441
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,210
Worradej!

442
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,780
Open up, Worradej!

443
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,340
Hey! Why the hell are you locking doors?

444
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,190
I told you not to do that!

445
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,780
This is my house…
no one gets private space here!

446
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,950
Hey!

447
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,460
You hear me? Come unlock this door!

448
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,960
Don’t leave me out here
yelling like a lunatic!

449
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,690
Open up, damn it!

450
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,520
Who’s in there?

451
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,120
If you don’t open up,
I’ll have someone bust that door down!

452
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,690
It’s me, Jade, sir.

453
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,970
Jade, you brat.

454
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,710
You think you can mess with me?

455
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,360
You heard me,
so why didn’t you open up?

456
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,260
I’ve got business with Worradej.

457
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,790
Uh… he’s asleep, sir.

458
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,700
Then wake him up, dammit!

459
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,250
If you don’t dare wake him,
unlock the door!

460
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,200
I’ll drag him outta bed myself!

461
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,620
Please don’t come in yet, sir.

462
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,170
Uh… he’s sleeping naked.

463
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,750
Not really something you wanna see.

464
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,260
I’ve seen him naked since the day
he popped outta his mama.

465
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,110
What’s the big deal seeing it again?

466
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,690
Open up! Even you got to see it!

467
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,630
Papa dear…

468
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:01,060
I’m still feeling woozy from when
you hit me with that cane the other day.

469
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,860
My head’s still spinning, seriously.

470
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:09,500
Can you maybe come yell
at me some other time, please?

471
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,420
What’s up with your voice?

472
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,910
Um… I got whacked in
the throat with the cane, too.

473
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,600
Quit acting pitiful.

474
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,550
You’ve taken plenty of my whacks and lived.

475
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,580
Now get out here and let me see you!

476
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,180
Maybe one or two more
whacks and you’ll be cured.

477
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,710
What’s wrong with you?

478
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,590
I’m gonna throw up, sir.

479
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,660
Agh! Jade, go get a cloth…quick!

480
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,780
Yes, sir! Hold it in, please!
Don’t let it out yet!

481
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,730
You just puked all over my head!

482
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,500
Ugh, master!

483
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,220
What did you even eat, sir?

484
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,400
That stinks, for real.

485
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,530
Yeah, yeah.

486
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,560
You just rest and get better first.

487
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,830
Then I’ll deal with you properly.

488
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,820
Hey, Kosol.

489
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,510
Make sure you eat plenty this meal, alright?

490
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,130
Count Worradej is footing the bill.

491
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,860
You sneaked out like this…

492
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,730
aren’t you scared your dad will freak out?

493
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,310
If he wants to freak out, let him.
I’m not there anymore.

494
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,550
Not my business.
I don’t care what happens.

495
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,800
Why should I be scared?

496
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,630
You haven’t forgotten, right?

497
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,290
That your father’s our enemy?

498
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,100
You’re the son of our rival.

499
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,680
And then...

500
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,480
this “group of ours”
you keep talking about…

501
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:56,980
So what is this group of yours?

502
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:00,050
It was the Viwat People group,
personally founded by Banjong.

503
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,850
There’s me, you, Pandao…

504
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,600
and a bunch of others too.

505
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,550
We all share the same goal:

506
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,730
to take Chaiyached off the throne.

507
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,040
Are you saying...

508
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,380
we’re staging a rebellion?

509
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,000
Yeah.

510
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,850
That’s intense.

511
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,250
So then...

512
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,020
who’s gonna take the throne?

513
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,270
No one.

514
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,100
We’re changing the system.

515
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,230
Even more intense.

516
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,800
So what kind of system
are we switching to?

517
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,130
My lord...

518
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,660
Thank you so much, sir.

519
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,690
If I hadn’t gotten this rice today,

520
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,480
me and my kid would’ve gone
another day without food.

521
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,750
It’s alright.

522
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,130
But I can’t come hand out
food like this every day.

523
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,650
Where’s the kid’s father?

524
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,350
Didn’t he help raise your child?

525
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,590
He got drafted to war last year.

526
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,840
Word is, he died on the battlefield.

527
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,400
But let’s not dwell on sad stories.

528
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,490
Don’t wanna bring down your mood, my lord.

529
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,700
I’ll be off then.

530
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,600
Sweetheart, bow to the nobleman.

531
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,910
Wait a sec.

532
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,980
Thank you, sir.

533
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,240
Hey, Kosol…

534
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,140
If her husband died at war like that,

535
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,380
shouldn’t she get
some sort of compensation?

536
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,540
Peasants are their master’s property.

537
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,130
It’s like breaking a drinking glass…

538
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,270
you just sweep it up and move on.

539
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,740
So then...

540
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,590
those people we saw at the market…

541
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,450
are they all peasants too?

542
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,200
Who do they even belong to?

543
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,870
Each one’s got a different owner.

544
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:57,680
Today they can earn
a few coins to feed their families,

545
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,940
but next month…

546
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,550
they might get conscripted
to work at some noble’s home,

547
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,190
with no pay at all.

548
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,710
They’d even have to pack their own rice.

549
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,020
And stop their own work for a whole month.

550
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,760
How are they ever
supposed to build a life like that?

551
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,550
If things stay the way they are…

552
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,910
they’ll never stand a chance.

553
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,110
That’s why, isn’t it?

554
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,480
That we’re trying to change everything.

555
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,380
Is it urgent business?

556
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:38,040
To come disturb my rest like this?

557
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,450
It’s very urgent, Your Majesty.

558
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,980
If Your Majesty doesn’t act fast,

559
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,430
you’ll be in danger yourself.

560
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,800
I discovered a plot to overthrow the throne

561
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,530
drawn up by Lord Kosol, Your Majesty.

562
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,930
(Sorn – Damrong: mastermind)

563
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,680
(Kosol)

564
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,530
(Jiam – Kaew – Jerd:
fake news network)

565
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,350
What is this?

566
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,570
I don’t understand it at all.

567
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,390
Didn’t you just make this up?

568
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,470
I had someone sneak into
Lord Kosol’s house.

569
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,380
That’s where I found this diagram.

570
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,010
And it fits the situation.

571
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:25,390
You were attacked near
that very house, after all.

572
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,750
Your Majesty must take action against
Lord Kosol at once.

573
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,990
Thank you, Count, for your concern.

574
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,820
I shall summon Lord Kosol
for questioning at a later time.

575
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,970
If that’s all, you may leave now.

576
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,790
If Your Majesty won’t act…

577
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,370
then I may have to inform
Somdet Saenyakorn as required.

578
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,530
And by then…

579
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,130
he’ll bring troops from
the capital to Singhanakhon.

580
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,210
He’ll personally deal
with Lord Kosol himself.

581
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,340
That Somdet Saenyakorn...

582
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,800
he’s the one who proposed the law
punishing same-sex love with jail time.

583
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,170
Hmm.

584
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,730
So it’s Saenyakorn.

585
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,780
He’s the root of it all.
The one who made queers suffer for centuries.

586
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,250
If we can stop him now…

587
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,480
then those who come after us

588
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,620
won’t have to endure
these cruel laws anymore.

589
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,950
At first, hearing you wanted
to start a rebellion…

590
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,970
it sounded terrifying.

591
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,060
But now that I know why,
it’s actually for the people’s good.

592
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,840
You’re full, aren’t you?

593
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,280
Let’s go.

594
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,500
Kosol…

595
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,340
can I take some khanom krok with me?

596
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,940
I really like them.

597
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,410
Wait up, Kosol…

598
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,800
Carry this for me.

599
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,850
My hands are full.

600
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,660
Hold on…what’s this…

601
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,890
Someone must’ve ratted us out…

602
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,100
saying the two of us were
walking arm in arm at the market.

603
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,990
Come on, what’s the big deal…

604
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,230
two guys linking arms, seriously?

605
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,030
Ugh, do they have to go this far?

606
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,700
All tough with commoners…

607
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,290
but tell me this for real…

608
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,570
have they ever won a single war?

609
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:21,280
Royal decree from King Chaiyached…

610
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:24,420
on suspicion that Lord Kosol

611
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,320
is behind the attempted regicide.

612
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,450
Therefore, it is commanded…

613
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,910
that Lord Kosol undergo the firewalk ritual…

614
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:34,200
to prove his innocence.

615
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,340
Receive the royal decree!

616
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,200
Oh please, brother…

617
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,480
forcing a living man to walk through fire?

618
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,690
He’s either gonna burn or… burn.

619
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,630
And when exactly does innocence get proven?

620
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:48,100
Ugh, Kosol…what are you even thinking?

621
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,310
Are you out of your mind?

622
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,910
Let them think what they want.

623
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,950
Tell your master this for me…

624
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,700
if he wants to capture me…

625
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:41,190
he better send soldiers
who can actually fight.

626
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,270
I’ll be waiting.

627
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,600
That look…

628
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,790
we're in trouble for sure.

629
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,980
Let me go…ouch!

630
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:59,250
Where are you dragging me?

631
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,320
Kosol, I said let go!

632
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,190
Hey!

633
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,000
Why so rough?

634
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,330
Did you call the soldiers on me?

635
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,940
I didn’t do anything!

636
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:12,280
Why would I?

637
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,480
Besides, the soldiers said it themselves

638
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,770
it was King Chaiyached’s order.

639
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,929
You accused me just the other day

640
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:21,190
of killing my own little brother.

641
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,179
So today you might be teaming up
with them to get rid of me.

642
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:29,429
I swear…may my face break out forever…

643
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:30,960
I didn’t do it!

644
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,199
And you…

645
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,600
are you really sure
you didn’t kill Chaiyached?

646
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,810
Listen carefully.

647
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:40,510
Yes, I plan to overthrow him…

648
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,380
but I don’t need to kill him.

649
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:44,320
Why waste the effort…

650
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,980
on one pathetic boy?

651
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:49,159
I just need to chain him up
and throw him in a dung pit.

652
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,900
But you're the one planning a rebellion.

653
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,040
If you didn’t assassinate him…
then who did?

654
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,130
Who else?

655
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,790
I'm not the only one with
plans to overthrow the throne.

656
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,700
That bastard Warlord Saenyakorn’s
been eyeing power too.

657
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:02,350
And the one serving him loyally…

658
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,880
you know who it is.

659
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,910
It’s your father.

660
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,440
My Lord Father?

661
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,640
Don’t play dumb with me.

662
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,150
You’re his son. You know the truth.

663
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,290
While I’m on the run…

664
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,690
you’re staying here as my hostage.

665
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:21,020
Come here.

666
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,000
You're the worst!

667
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,080
I’m nobody’s captive lover, you know!

668
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,390
Ow! I’ll file a report…

669
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:29,030
you're unlawfully detaining me!

670
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:30,110
Help!

671
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,870
Flowers within reach…

672
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,790
how tempting to hold them close.

673
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,330
But still I hesitate…

674
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,770
are you pure or poison?

675
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,250
Brother Banjong!
It’s bad, Brother Banjong!

676
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,080
What’s all the commotion, Pandao?

677
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,200
I'm working here…you scared me!

678
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,370
Brother Kosol got surrounded by
soldiers at the market.

679
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,170
They accused him of attempted regicide.

680
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,630
What?

681
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,480
What’s happening now?

682
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,730
Did they catch him?

683
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,400
Not yet. They say he escaped
into the forest with Worradej.

684
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:24,290
Brother Banjong, I’m sure it was Worradej

685
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,880
he’s the one who called the soldiers.

686
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,320
I told you we shouldn’t trust him.

687
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,440
(A flower within reach, tempting to hold close,
but still I wonder, is it sweet or sinister?)

688
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,540
Are we really doing this?

689
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,360
Are we seriously gonna live
in the forest like this?

690
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,440
What are we even gonna eat?

691
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,620
There's no toilet or anything.

692
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,570
And wild beasts, too.

693
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,690
But I forgot…

694
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:09,610
you’re more savage than any beast.

695
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,580
How many days are we stuck out here?

696
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,180
Don’t even know where we’ll bathe.

697
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,560
Why does my life have to be this miserable?

698
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,870
I just want to go home.

699
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,630
Ugh, and now I’m stuck…

700
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,960
why...

701
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:32,010
Fine, I’m done talking.

702
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,960
Go cut some banana leaves.

703
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,770
I’ll use them to build a shelter.

704
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,750
Seriously?

705
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:53,080
From an influencer
with over 3 million followers…

706
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:57,010
Now I’m a forest girl
chopping banana leaves for a hut?

707
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,410
Ugh.

708
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,600
If I had my phone right now…

709
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:04,070
I’d be posting the juiciest TokTok content.

710
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,170
So? Where are the banana leaves?

711
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:11,940
If I can’t find any…

712
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,240
do I have to grow
a banana tree from scratch,

713
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,100
wait for it to sprout, then harvest it?

714
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,440
If I come back empty-handed,

715
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,570
I’ll get murdered and dumped
in the woods for sure. Ugh!

716
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,980
What the heck is that?

717
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,210
A deer? An elk?

718
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,600
A lion? Or a tapir?

719
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,960
Don’t you come any closer!

720
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,590
I’ll fight, I swear!

721
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:51,630
Aww, it’s a lil bunny.

722
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,930
You’re so adorable.

723
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,850
What’s your name, sweetie?

724
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,380
Are you lost too?

725
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:03,030
Kosol, look…isn’t
this cutie just the sweetest?

726
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,230
Can I keep the bunny?

727
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,970
You killed the bunny right in front of me.

728
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,290
I’m not eating it. No way I could.

729
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,470
Didn’t I teach you already?

730
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:35,010
That the weak

731
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,580
are prey to the strong.

732
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,920
But we should still show mercy.

733
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,220
If you’re stronger,

734
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:43,300
you should be protecting the weak,
not hurting them.

735
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,600
You’re way bigger than that bunny.

736
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,740
This…

737
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,180
this is bullying the helpless.

738
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,610
So are you eating or not?

739
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,550
I’m not.

740
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:56,570
Eat.

741
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,270
So…

742
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,790
what about the right thigh?

743
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,080
Here, take it.

744
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,260
Tear it for me.

745
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,190
You’re such a high-maintenance brat.

746
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,830
What are we doing here, Kosol?

747
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,940
Stripped down like
this…obviously, we’re bathing.

748
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,660
Can I skip it?

749
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,490
I’m cold.

750
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:11,030
You go ahead and bathe alone.

751
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,040
No.

752
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,510
You have to bathe too.

753
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,660
Because you’re sleeping next to me tonight.

754
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,520
And I don’t want to smell your stink.

755
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,790
What are you doing?

756
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,470
Are you trying to assault me?

757
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,000
Let go! Let go!

758
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,390
Hurry and undress.

759
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:27,120
Let go! I said stop! Stop!

760
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,730
You’re a savage, a power freak.

761
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,150
Always forcing yourself on people.

762
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,980
This is pure toxic masculinity.

763
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:38,070
Think you’re king of
the world or something?

764
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,880
What are you so shocked about?

765
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,990
Acting like it’s your first time seeing one.

766
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,450
Don’t think I’ll swoon just
‘cause it looks good.

767
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,010
I’m still not bathing
with you no matter what.

768
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,160
I don’t know what
I let you get away with before,

769
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:59,900
but from now on,
I won’t let it happen again.

770
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,650
Worradej is not your victim anymore.

771
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,840
Are you trying to turn me on?

772
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:11,940
You say one thing,
but your eyes say another.

773
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,010
I’m not.

774
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,600
It’s slippery.

775
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,190
Help!

776
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,190
It’s shallow. You won’t drown.

777
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,470
And in this water...

778
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,340
Are there snakes or crocs?

779
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,210
I’m scared.

780
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:47,690
Didn’t you say it yourself?

781
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,150
That in this whole forest,

782
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:50,860
I’m the fiercest beast?

783
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,190
Don’t panic.

784
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,020
With me, you’ve got nothing to fear.

785
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:03,480
Worradej...

786
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,330
When you’re soaking wet,

787
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,040
you’re dangerously attractive to me.

788
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:34,130
You’re dangerously attractive to me too.

789
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,190
It feels like...

790
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,390
something brushed against my leg.

791
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,570
It’s my snakehead fish.

792
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,000
Something else just swam into my leg too.

793
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,860
That’s my striped snakehead.

794
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,230
Kosol...

795
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,220
Can I...

796
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:08,330
touch the little one for a bit?

797
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:10,240
Go ahead.

798
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,470
Just don’t let it bite.

799
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,970
Tell me right now…

800
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:45,110
about my relationship…

801
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:47,250
What exactly is going on
between you and Banjong?

802
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:48,720
And where’s Kosol now?

803
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:51,920
Last seen hiding
in the western forest, sir.

804
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,010
This time I’ve finally
caught up with you, brother.

805
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,650
Turn yourself in peacefully.

806
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,260
Worradej, where are you hiding Kosol?

807
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,690
What do you mean?
I don’t know anything!

808
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,020
Jade’s just a servant…
he wouldn’t dare harm Lord Kosol.

809
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:06,900
I bet Kosol’s already been captured.

810
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,580
(Shooting a water scene in winter)

811
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:13,790
(So cold…need a hug)

812
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,960
(But once filming’s done)

813
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:17,380
Wanna hop in and play too?
(Suddenly happy)

814
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,070
Whoa (Blushing, maybe?)

815
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,880
Hold on, I hiccupped…just a sec
(Someone get Kosol a glass of water)

816
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:24,440
I just learned that

817
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,380
this kind of coin
was used back in the day.

818
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:27,720
Is this shell money?

819
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,610
- Gonna give in or not?
- Go full force!

820
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,010
Shove me hard! (Give it your all!)

821
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,280
(That must’ve hurt)

822
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:35,760
Help!

823
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:37,400
Somebody help me! Anyone here?
