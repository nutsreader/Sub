1
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:29,440
This time, I’ve finally caught you, bro.

2
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,680
Take a good look at yourself.

3
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,759
Why not call all your soldiers at once?

4
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,680
Keep an eye on Jade.

5
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,240
He might know where
Kosol and Worradech are.

6
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,200
Damn Worradech.

7
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,320
Are you crazy, Pandao?

8
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,520
Where did you hide Kosol?

9
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,640
Hide what? I don’t know anything.

10
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,280
Ever since I time-traveled here,

11
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,080
it’s been non-stop chaos, Prince.

12
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,640
Always something new.

13
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,840
Jade, climb up now!

14
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,880
Yes, sir.

15
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,040
I’ll help pull the rope.

16
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,600
M-My Lord…

17
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,960
My Lord.

18
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,240
- Stop
- Stop!

19
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,880
- Stop
- Let go!

20
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,040
- Stop it, I said!
- Let me go!

21
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,800
My Lord.

22
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,280
- Let go of me!
- Stay still, damn it!

23
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,040
Don’t move.

24
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,160
(Singhanakhon Prison)

25
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,200
Thanks.

26
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,880
Let’s say we’re helping each other out.

27
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,280
But I’ll give you only the time it takes
to boil an egg.

28
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,520
If the master finds out, I’ll be scolded.

29
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,400
Banjong.

30
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,200
How is Worradech?

31
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Did the Count capture him?

32
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,920
No.

33
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,560
He wasn’t caught.

34
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,680
Then where is he now?

35
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,240
Answer me, Banjong.

36
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,280
Where is Worradech now?

37
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,680
He said he was going
to see King Chaiyached.

38
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,000
But…

39
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,160
But what, Banjong?

40
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Tell me what really happened.

41
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,680
Nothing.

42
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,360
Nothing happened.

43
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,240
I just worry about you.

44
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,760
Locked up in prison…

45
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,640
It must be rough for you.

46
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,840
Oh, please.

47
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,200
Don’t spout nonsense to my face.

48
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,159
This is the time
we need to be planning.

49
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,400
I already have a plan.

50
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,760
The day I walk through fire,

51
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
will be the day we claim victory.

52
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,040
Hurry up.

53
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,720
I’m giving you only
the time it takes to boil an egg.

54
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,920
Thank you so much, sir.

55
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,480
Lord Kosol, Lord Kosol, sir!

56
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,680
Something happened!

57
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,600
I honestly don’t know
who else I can turn to.

58
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
If people outside can’t help you,

59
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,880
how can someone in prison like me?

60
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,680
Please, hear me out first.

61
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,280
The Count just snuck into
the Singhapiman Palace,

62
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,480
begging the King for your pardon.

63
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,000
But suddenly, a gunshot rang out,

64
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,280
and the Count fell
into the palace grounds.

65
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,920
What did you say?

66
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,320
Worradech was shot?

67
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,520
Yes, sir.

68
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,080
I don’t know if he’s alive or dead.

69
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,880
I tried to go after him,
but the guards threw me out.

70
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,440
Here’s how you deal with soldiers,

71
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,400
the second vertebra of the neck.

72
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,080
Fix your aim on it.

73
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,000
Then strike down with force.

74
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,480
He’ll be out cold in no time.

75
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,800
And how hard do I strike

76
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,560
to knock him out in one blow?

77
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,320
As much force as you can muster,
that’s how hard you strike.

78
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,880
Back again?

79
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,440
Looking for another beating, huh?

80
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,640
No, sir. I came to report something.

81
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,320
What happened?

82
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,080
Hey, what the hell is that?

83
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,400
What are you looking for?

84
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,400
I’m searching for Count Worradech.

85
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,800
My desire,

86
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,400
how far have you gone with it?

87
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,760
You keep nagging me.

88
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,559
I already know your deepest wish,

89
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,600
to make Banjong
fall in love with you, right?

90
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,120
Give it time, uncle.
When it comes to men,

91
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,360
I’m a pro.

92
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,520
It’s just right now
I’m caught up dealing with Kosol.

93
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,840
No.

94
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,360
My desire,

95
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,680
it’s not only about Banjong.

96
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,440
It’s about Kosol too.

97
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,680
Oh my god.

98
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,800
Wait,

99
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,600
don’t tell me you want me to…

100
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,520
Two-timing, huh?

101
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,640
Would people in this era
even accept that?

102
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,800
A wife with two husbands?

103
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,520
This isn’t about love.

104
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,520
I didn’t die because of love.

105
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,840
If it wasn’t love,

106
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,800
then tell me what you want me to do.

107
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,600
Stop with the riddles.
I’m tired of guessing.

108
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,840
You already know this.

109
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
Because my desire

110
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,720
is the same as yours.

111
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,920
My desire is your desire.

112
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,920
My desire is your desire.

113
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,680
My desire is your desire.

114
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,760
My desire is your desire.

115
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,920
My desire is your desire.

116
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,040
My Lord, you’re alive.

117
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,560
My Lord!

118
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,600
Jade.

119
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,800
Your Majesty.

120
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,440
May I ask, like a heroine

121
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,720
who just woke from a coma,

122
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,000
where am I?

123
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,200
And how did I end up here?

124
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,200
This is the Singhapiman Palace.

125
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,040
You climbed over here yourself, didn’t you?

126
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,520
The guards said you were shot,
but only grazed on the arm.

127
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,440
So I had the royal physician treat you.

128
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,240
It is Your Majesty’s boundless grace.

129
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,760
No need for formality, you’re still hurt.

130
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,080
At that moment,
I couldn’t remember a thing.

131
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,400
I suddenly blacked out.

132
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,680
You must’ve hit your head when you fell.

133
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,760
That’s why you lost consciousness.

134
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,360
Who hates you so much
they’d want you dead?

135
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,640
This is the second
assassination attempt, isn’t it?

136
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,080
Seems you and I share
the same enemies.

137
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,280
That’s true, Your Majesty.

138
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,920
But let’s put that aside for now.

139
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,760
The reason I climbed into the palace tonight

140
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,920
was to deliver something important.

141
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,080
Lord Kosol is not the one
trying to assassinate you.

142
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,360
Please cancel the trial by fire.

143
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,720
I already know that.

144
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,120
Kosol would never wish me harm.

145
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,240
In fact, he’s been nothing but loyal.

146
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,320
Then why…

147
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,040
why would you still send him
to the trial by fire?

148
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,640
That’s like sending him
to die for nothing.

149
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,200
Because of Lord Singhanakhon,
your father.

150
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,480
He kept pestering me, insisting
Kosol tried to kill me.

151
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,800
While he himself plotted
with King Saenyakorn.

152
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,720
I didn’t know what else to do,

153
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,560
so I sent Kosol into the trial first,

154
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,080
planning to find a way
to save him later.

155
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,840
So that means…

156
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,680
you already have a way
to save him, right?

157
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,880
What’s the plan, Your Majesty?

158
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,160
I haven’t figured it out yet.

159
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,040
Help me think of one.

160
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,920
Wait, you can do that?

161
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,040
Hurry, Count.

162
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,800
I’m giving you only
the time it takes to boil an egg.

163
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,200
Then make it an ostrich egg, darling,
so I get more time.

164
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,120
Kosol.

165
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,960
Was Worradech shot?

166
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,720
No one knows if he’s alive or dead.

167
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,600
Kosol, are you all right?

168
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,160
They didn’t torture you,

169
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,160
force you to confess anything, did they?

170
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,480
Worry about yourself first.

171
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,880
Weren’t you the one ambushed?

172
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,720
How bad is it?

173
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,960
It’s nothing serious,
just a graze.

174
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,880
Lucky King Chaiyached found me.

175
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,800
so he had the royal physician treat me.

176
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,240
Hmm, fine then.

177
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,240
So why are you here?

178
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,880
Don’t you know
you’re disturbing my training?

179
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,560
Hey, I came out of concern.

180
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,120
Why must you speak so coldly?

181
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,120
The reason I came,

182
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,320
Come here.

183
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,720
Kosol.

184
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,400
What?

185
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,640
Come closer.

186
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,120
Just say it already.

187
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,440
I don’t like secrets.

188
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
This can’t be said out loud.

189
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,640
It has to be whispered.

190
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,520
Quickly.

191
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,720
King Chaiyached

192
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,440
knows you’re not the one
who tried to kill him.

193
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,440
But he must hold the trial by fire
to keep the nobles fooled.

194
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,600
He’ll find a way to save you later.

195
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,360
For heaven’s sake,
I thought it was serious.

196
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,760
Go back and tell him,

197
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,200
there’s no need to trouble himself
finding a way.

198
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,880
I’m ready to face the ritual.

199
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,480
Whether it’s fire or water.

200
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,000
I’m always ready.

201
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,240
Hey.

202
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,880
Don’t get cocky, Kosol.

203
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,000
The reason I came today

204
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,240
is to break you out of prison.

205
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,680
I won’t go.

206
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,400
I choose to stay here.

207
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,720
Ugh!

208
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,760
What kind of man
actually likes staying in jail?

209
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,560
Or do you already have
a plan of your own?

210
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,320
No plan.

211
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,880
Tch.

212
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,200
Hey, Mister Electricity Authority,

213
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,960
you sure love killing the vibe.

214
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,760
Brother Banjong.

215
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,960
Any word on Worradech?

216
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,080
I shot him.

217
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,080
When he was on the palace wall.

218
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,640
He fell into the palace grounds.

219
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
By now, he’s probably dead.

220
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,600
Let him be dead for real,
so we can finally rest easy.

221
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,400
And when you spoke with Kosol,

222
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,920
what did you find out?

223
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,440
The day of the trial by fire
will be our day of victory.

224
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,600
A grand move indeed.

225
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,800
I’ll tell you the plan later.

226
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,400
For now, we need to move
into Kosol’s house.

227
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,360
Because the Count already knows

228
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,320
I’ve sided with Kosol.

229
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,080
Hurry and pack only the essentials.

230
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,920
Go.

231
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,360
I’ve finished packing.

232
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,600
Take only what’s necessary.

233
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,320
Once we reach Kosol’s house,
we’ll regroup.

234
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,440
I still doubt Worradech’s fate.

235
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,400
I have a feeling he’s not dead yet.

236
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,560
I shot him with my own hand.

237
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,160
Are you saying I missed?

238
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,320
That’s not it.

239
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,520
And this isn’t the time
to argue over it.

240
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,880
I heard news,

241
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,600
the Count’s men are heading
to our house.

242
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,360
We need to go, now.

243
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,280
Go!

244
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,080
Lord Banjong, open the door now!

245
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,200
If you don’t, I’ll break it down.

246
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,080
Kosol,

247
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,720
tell me your plan straight.

248
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,800
I don’t believe

249
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,840
you’d just surrender and burn
without a scheme.

250
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,360
My plan is to slaughter a cow,

251
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,640
skewer it, and roast it in my place.

252
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,040
Then I’ll hand it out
to the villagers to feast on.

253
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,280
Oh, come on,

254
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,800
that’s not funny.

255
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,440
Be serious.

256
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,800
Haven’t things always gone well before?

257
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,400
Or if you’ve forgotten,

258
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,960
shall I refresh your memory
through these bars?

259
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,320
Don’t think you can just
force yourself on anyone.

260
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,880
You do it to me,

261
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,760
I’ll do it right back to you.

262
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,520
Eye for an eye.

263
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,720
Tooth for a tooth.

264
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,600
Hey!

265
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,640
What are you two doing?

266
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,960
Give me a little more time.

267
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,560
Go boil ten more eggs
if you have to.

268
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,000
I’ll pay you in full.

269
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,360
That’s impossible, sir.

270
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,640
The Lord is already on his way here.

271
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,280
Lord Kosol.

272
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,160
Stand and pay your respects
to the Count right now.

273
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,760
Lord Kosol, did you hear my command?

274
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,040
Forget it.

275
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,000
He’s already as good as dead.

276
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,520
Let him do whatever he wants.

277
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,160
Kosol,

278
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,520
I’ve captured Banjong and his men already.

279
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,040
If you don’t want your friends to die,

280
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,880
you better tell me

281
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,520
what you were planning
while gathering your forces.

282
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,000
If you’ve already caught them,

283
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,680
then ask them.

284
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,800
Why bother asking me?

285
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,520
You’re supposed to be a grown man.

286
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,960
Lying doesn’t suit you.

287
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,800
I know,

288
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,160
Banjong and his men escaped
before you even got to their house.

289
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,120
Don’t play games with me.

290
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,400
No food or water for him
starting today,

291
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,960
until the trial by fire.

292
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,920
Darling.

293
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,480
Kosol,

294
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,280
Kosol.

295
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,240
Even if you act cold
and pretend you don’t care,

296
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,680
I still can’t help worrying about you.

297
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,680
So I’ll ask you one last time,

298
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,560
will you run away with me?

299
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,000
Fine.

300
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,240
If you won’t leave,

301
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,480
then I’ll stay here with you.

302
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,840
Hey, hey, wait.

303
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,120
What are you doing?

304
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,520
Come here.

305
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,880
Ow, ow, easy, darling!

306
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,560
Ow!

307
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,520
Please, go ahead.

308
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,440
Next time, be gentle with me, darling.

309
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,520
- No rush, no pressure.
- Hey!

310
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,320
Worradech,

311
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,600
how did they manage to lock you up?

312
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,080
What happened?

313
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,920
If I tell you,

314
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,480
don’t get jealous.

315
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,440
I just…

316
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,800
stole a couple kisses
from the guard’s cheek.

317
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,920
So they threw me in here with you.

318
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,080
Ugh, what a mess.

319
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,320
Turns out,

320
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,960
loving the same sex

321
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,320
is as serious as treason here.

322
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,480
It’s done, Your Majesty.

323
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,800
If there’s nothing else,

324
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,280
I’ll take my leave
and report to the Count.

325
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,000
You’ve been gone so long,
I was really worried.

326
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,960
Jade.

327
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,480
Yes, sir.

328
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
I’ve watched you many times.

329
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,400
You’re loyal, devoted,
and love with your whole heart.

330
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,320
Enough to even die for it.

331
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,760
I’ll take you in
as one of my royal pages.

332
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,120
Uh,

333
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,920
I’m just a fool, Your Majesty.

334
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,760
I can’t even read.

335
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
If I serve by your side,

336
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,720
I’d only become a burden.

337
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,600
You’re already surrounded
by so many able men.

338
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,520
I’m not worthy, Your Majesty.

339
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,760
It’s those around me
that I fear the most.

340
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,240
The reason I came to Singhanakhon

341
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,520
is because in the Grand Palace
someone plotted against me.

342
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,360
I had to flee, pretending
I came to visit my brother.

343
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,000
See, even the royal guards

344
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,520
who’ve followed me for years
cannot be trusted.

345
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,520
The river bend ahead,

346
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,120
that’s where the nobles
have hidden assassins, waiting.

347
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,800
Prepare yourself well.

348
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,600
Your Majesty.

349
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,280
Please, board the boat.

350
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,880
So we can continue the journey quickly.

351
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,360
I fear nightfall will catch us.

352
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,280
Ugh!

353
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,760
Wait here a moment.

354
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,320
I’ve got a stomachache.

355
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,960
Need to step into the market
for a quick errand.

356
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,960
Uh, please don’t, Your Majesty.

357
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,520
I’ll hang a cloth for cover.

358
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,880
Then Your Majesty may relieve yourself
in the royal chamber pot.

359
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,880
No way, I hate chamber pots.

360
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,440
Sitting on them chills me to the bone.

361
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,520
Don’t follow me.

362
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,120
I’ll be back in just a moment.

363
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,360
Thief! Thief!

364
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,120
Thief! He stole the cloth!

365
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,800
Stop! Stop right there, you thief!

366
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,160
From king to common thief,

367
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,680
can you imagine

368
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,960
how tragic my life has become?

369
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,480
Even here in Singhanakhon,
no one can be trusted.

370
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,240
These days,

371
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,600
I don’t sleep peacefully at night.

372
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,760
Wherever I walk,
I must watch my back.

373
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,440
Every meal I eat,
I first toss to the dogs to test.

374
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,560
Jade,

375
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,120
Be my personal page, Jade.

376
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,720
But I belong to Count Singhanakhon, sire.

377
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,200
Whatever your ransom may be,

378
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,640
I can pay it, don’t you worry.

379
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,240
I’ve served Count Worradech

380
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,280
for decades, faithfully.

381
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,000
I don’t want to…

382
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,640
- I don’t want,
- I am the King.

383
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,960
Everything in this land is mine.

384
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,680
Would Worradech really defy me?

385
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,160
If I can’t take you from him,
then so be it.

386
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,920
Why that look on your face?

387
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,680
You don’t want to be with me?

388
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,920
I wouldn’t dare disobey, sire.

389
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,280
Good.

390
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,040
Then from this moment on,
you will serve only me.

391
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,480
As you command, Your Majesty.

392
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,280
Your first duty,

393
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,520
rock my cradle.

394
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,880
Yes, sire.

395
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,680
Jade.

396
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,560
Harder.

397
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,400
Jade, harder.

398
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,240
Why that face again?

399
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,880
Can you manage?

400
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,720
Harder.

401
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,480
Careful, you’ll fall in the water!

402
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,680
How deep could it be?

403
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,040
I’m scared.

404
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,920
Oh, oh,

405
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,280
Jade.

406
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,160
Go fetch me the cicada.

407
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,280
Yes, sire.

408
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,120
Are you hungry?

409
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,760
Not at all.

410
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,200
Then what’s that growling
in your stomach?

411
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,520
Don’t tell me it’s thunder.

412
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,000
Stop distracting me, will you?

413
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,360
I’m hypnotizing myself.

414
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,880
Full. So full.

415
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,920
Stuffed. Ugh!

416
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,560
Serves you right.

417
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,760
You really think
prison life is fun, huh?

418
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,480
It’s because of you.

419
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,160
I even threw myself in here
to be with you.

420
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,160
Will you finally tell me your plan?

421
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,640
Why should you know?

422
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,480
Because I care about you.
I don’t want you to die.

423
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,480
If you’re planning
something reckless,

424
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,120
I need to stop you.

425
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,160
Even if I know I can’t stop you.

426
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,840
I’m glad,

427
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,680
that you worry about me.

428
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,080
But the reason I can’t share my plan

429
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,480
is because I worry about you too.

430
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,720
So,

431
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,720
that means…

432
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,360
your plan is really dangerous, isn’t it?

433
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,120
Tell me right now, Kosol!

434
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,200
The more I love you,

435
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,640
the less I can tell you.

436
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,960
Then stop loving me
and just tell me already!

437
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,360
I can’t stop,
my heart’s already yours.

438
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,160
Ugh, I just want to grab your hair
and kick you both legs at once.

439
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,200
Wait, wait!

440
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,760
What?

441
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,880
Don’t be stubborn.

442
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,720
I’m starving.

443
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,200
Hang in there a bit longer.

444
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,480
My Lord.

445
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,800
Jade.

446
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,640
How did you end up in there, sir?

447
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,040
What happened?

448
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,680
Forget that for now.

449
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,640
Do you have any food on you?

450
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,000
I haven’t eaten anything
since yesterday.

451
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,480
I brought some with me,
my Lord.

452
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,480
Knew you’d been gone
all night.

453
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,320
You must be starving.

454
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,960
Here, my Lord.

455
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,400
Perfect timing too.

456
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,080
Had to sneak it past
the guards.

457
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,200
Thanks, then I’ll
dig in first.

458
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,320
- Here.
- I’m not hungry.

459
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,760
Just shut up
and eat already.

460
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,240
Thanks.

461
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,880
So tell me...

462
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,000
How did you end up
locked in here, my Lord?

463
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,240
Did you break some rule?

464
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,840
I was trying to squeeze
a secret out of Kosol.

465
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,080
So I kissed
the guard’s cheek.

466
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,120
And he threw me
straight in here.

467
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,720
Did you get the secret?

468
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,080
Hmph.

469
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,800
Got nothing at all.

470
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,200
Then...

471
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,800
How long will you
be stuck in here, my Lord?

472
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,280
Probably a while.

473
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,200
I don’t even know myself.

474
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,000
Ouch.

475
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,960
What the hell are you doing

476
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,000
Go

477
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,800
Jade

478
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,600
What have you been up to

479
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,480
I won’t let my master suffer

480
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,120
Wherever my master goes, I go

481
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,840
Always ready to serve

482
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,560
Jade, where are you

483
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,000
Jade

484
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,760
Jade

485
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,280
Have you seen Jade anywhere

486
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,560
He left the palace at dawn

487
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,520
Said he was heading to
the prison to find Count Worradech

488
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,320
Still clinging to his old master, huh

489
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,800
Of course

490
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,560
Guess I’ll never mean
as much as Worradech

491
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,560
So, what about the plan

492
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,679
Same as I told you

493
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,239
The Fire Trial is in two days

494
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
Are all sides set and ready

495
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,760
Our allies have all replied, brother

496
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,159
And we’ve prepared everything we need

497
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,199
Good

498
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,920
Then all that’s left is waiting

499
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,840
Once the whistle blows

500
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,480
Everyone, follow the plan now

501
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,159
Ready?

502
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,280
Lord Banjong, surrender yourself now

503
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,400
Stay back

504
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,120
Why must Lord Banjong surrender?

505
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,560
We found Lord Kosol at your estate

506
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,800
You’re guilty of sheltering
a traitor of the Crown

507
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,200
And thus, treason yourself

508
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,680
If you want me,
then break down the door

509
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,360
Smash it open

510
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,520
Come in

511
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,200
- Come on
- Wait

512
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,480
Stop

513
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,360
If we clash with the law today

514
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,920
it could ruin
everything two days from now

515
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,120
I will surrender

516
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,360
Brother Banjong

517
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,840
- But our plan,
- Pandao

518
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,520
I can’t afford to fail this time

519
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,880
I leave it to you now

520
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,960
Unbolt the door

521
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,680
Open it

522
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,600
Put the chains on me

523
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,400
I’ll go willingly

524
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,040
Banjong

525
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,440
Worradech

526
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,520
Is that really you?

527
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,280
How did you end up here?

528
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,760
I should be the one asking.

529
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,880
How did you get here?

530
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,520
I was arrested

531
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,280
for hiding Lord Kosol.

532
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,600
But tell me,

533
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,440
are you alright?

534
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,680
I’m fine.

535
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,320
Why would you even ask that?

536
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,000
Worradech.

537
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,040
Tell Banjong about the ambush.

538
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,840
When I was climbing the palace wall,

539
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,800
some lunatic took a shot at me.

540
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,480
Lucky for me, his aim was off.

541
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,400
The bullet just grazed my arm.

542
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,480
I’m so damn glad, Worradech,

543
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,200
that you’re still alive.

544
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,720
Was it you who fired?

545
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,040
I told you once,

546
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,200
never lay a finger on Worradech.

547
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,360
And you dared defy me?

548
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,680
Do you have a death wish?

549
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,320
I had no choice.

550
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,480
Worradech could blow our plan.

551
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,160
But you saw it yourself.

552
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,800
He chose to be locked up with me.

553
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,760
That means he's on our side.

554
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,560
Hey.

555
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,200
What are you talking about?

556
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,480
Are you plotting something?

557
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,480
Banjong, tell me right now.

558
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,680
No.

559
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,880
There’s no plan.

560
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,880
Kosol just asked me

561
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,920
what I had for breakfast.

562
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,920
Oh, please.

563
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,240
I’ve been nothing but honest with you two.

564
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,280
And you’re still hiding things from me?

565
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,720
Fine.

566
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,200
Do whatever the hell you want.

567
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,960
I’m done with this.

568
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,000
Worradech,

569
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,400
Don’t.

570
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,680
If you say Worradech is with us,

571
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,240
then he deserves to know the plan.

572
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,280
The fewer people who know, the better.

573
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,160
I won’t risk dragging him
into danger with us.

574
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,400
Master.

575
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,400
You can rest your head on my lap.

576
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,440
Thanks, love.

577
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,600
Banjong.

578
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,240
What is it?

579
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,400
Lie down.

580
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,280
I want you to rest easy.

581
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,720
Don’t resist.

582
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,920
Hey.

583
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,520
Lie down.

584
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,600
Jade.

585
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,520
Stroke my hair for me.

586
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,280
Uh… I shouldn’t.

587
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,480
The head is sacred.

588
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,720
Come on.

589
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,560
When I can’t sleep, I like
someone stroking my hair.

590
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,280
Then… may I?

591
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,080
You really like me stroking
your hair like this, Banjong?

592
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,560
Not really.

593
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,400
So you like it or not?

594
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,200
Well… I kinda do.

595
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,840
Jade, spank me a little.

596
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,400
Yes, my lord.

597
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,120
Go to sleep, Banjong.

598
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,920
I’ll lull you myself.

599
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,520
Lullaby, lullaby

600
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,160
Peek-a-boo

601
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,760
Jade, give me a goodnight kiss

602
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,160
What do you want me to do, My Lord?

603
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,040
Kiss me and say sweet dreams

604
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,640
I don’t dare, My Lord

605
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,320
Come on now

606
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,040
Don’t you want me to dream well?

607
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,720
I do, My Lord

608
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,160
Then go on…

609
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,040
Sweet dreams, My Lord

610
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,960
Sweet dreams, darling

611
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,760
Banjong

612
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,440
Tomorrow’s fire trial

613
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,640
must go flawlessly

614
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,360
Ready the troops

615
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,400
in case of any emergency

616
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,520
Count

617
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,360
Right now, Lord Kosol, Lord Banjong, Jade

618
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,280
and Count Worradech

619
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,600
are all locked up together

620
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,760
What?

621
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,280
Worradech too?

622
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,440
Yes, My Lord

623
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,200
Good

624
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,720
I’ll throw them all into the fire trial

625
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,120
What a damn stroke of luck

626
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,520
Two fools handed to me on a silver platter

627
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,920
And the other two waltzed
into my cage themselves

628
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,440
Perfect

629
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,360
Tomorrow I’ll drag you all

630
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,680
into the fire ritual before the crowd

631
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,000
Now that’ll be a show worth watching

632
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,920
The one who must walk through fire
to prove himself

633
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,680
is me and me alone

634
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,080
Why drag the others into it?

635
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,320
Because you’re all in the same pack

636
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,760
plotting rebellion together

637
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,520
Did you think I wouldn’t know?

638
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,160
And you, Banjong

639
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,440
While you worked by my side,
you spied on me

640
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,760
Did you really think you could fool me?

641
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,800
If I were a fool

642
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,880
I wouldn’t be Lord of this city

643
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,160
If you want to punish me

644
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,080
then do it

645
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,560
But please

646
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,440
let Worradech and Jade go

647
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,880
They know nothing of this, I swear

648
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,840
Worradech…

649
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,600
you ungrateful bastard

650
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,440
You’re coming with me.

651
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,280
I’ve got a special punishment just for you.

652
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,520
Let Worradech go.

653
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,960
- Don’t
- Come out

654
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,880
- Don’t come closer
- Get out now

655
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,280
Let go, let go!

656
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,760
Let go, I’m not going.

657
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,480
Let go! Let go!

658
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,160
I’m not going.

659
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,920
I’ll stay here with my friends.

660
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,480
Open the door!

661
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,800
- I said open it!
- Worradech!

662
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,640
Ungrateful brat, I broke you out

663
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,160
and you want to run back and die?

664
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,960
Do I need to beat some sense into you?

665
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,680
Hah? Hah?

666
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,320
Father and son fighting?

667
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,760
Now that’s entertaining.

668
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,680
Ta-da!

669
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,400
Worradech, what are you doing?

670
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,200
I’ll use science to craft a miracle.

671
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,000
My beloved stans,

672
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,360
give Mama a minute.

673
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,680
I’ll be back on stage real soon.

674
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,920
Where are you going?

675
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,880
Then I’m heading back home.

676
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,000
I don’t even know how to get there yet.

677
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,640
Or which way to go.

678
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,320
Why’s it so damn hard being a trans girl?

679
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,160
Sexy Naughty Bitchy
(Count, you’re serving beauty)

680
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,880
Oops, grabbed my boob.

681
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,080
Jade, don’t mess with the Count.

682
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,440
- Cut.
- Why only his hand turned black?

683
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,480
And why right in front of my face?

684
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,360
Didn’t touch / Can you wipe first?
(just playful teasing)

685
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,920
Now he’s grabbing my hair.

686
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,280
Sleep well, Banjong.

687
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,040
Lullaby.

688
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,920
Lullaby
(Sweet dreams, Banjong)

689
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,600
All of you, sleep well too.
I want sweet dreams for you.

690
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,120
Lullaby.

691
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,520
Lullaby
(now it’s my turn to soothe)

692
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,000
That’s it.
