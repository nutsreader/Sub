Don't you dare give up,

174
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
or I'll punch you.

175
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,460
What's with that look?

176
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,840
I'm touched.

177
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,630
You said that for me, right?

178
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,680
I'm sticking with you, big sis!

179
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,470
Hold on,

180
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,530
you're younger than me.

181
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,230
I will be loyal to you.

182
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,100
I don't need you though.

183
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,340
Stop clinging to me, it's hot.

184
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,850
Alright,

185
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,880
just let us know if you need any help.

186
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,330
Okay, I know you're the best.

187
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,540
Heart sign?

188
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,280
No.

189
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,490
-Make a heart sign.
-Nope.

190
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,580
Just make a heart sign.

191
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,380
No.

192
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,390
Junxi...

193
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,210
No way!

194
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,430
What are you looking for?

195
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,800
Your loyal puppy, Tuo.

196
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,030
Doesn't he always
come find you after class?

197
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,090
What happened? Has he gone MIA again?

198
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,300
He's interning at Zhan Wensen's agency.

199
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,560
He's busier than both of us at Stellaris,

200
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,810
and hasn't been to school lately.

201
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,550
We haven't seen each other
for over a week.

202
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,380
Won't he fail
if he skips too many classes?

203
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,520
He's finished all his credits
except internship.

204
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,570
That's impressive!

205
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,560
Of course,

206
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,450
he's the guy
who gets scholarships every semester.

207
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,670
His job must be so interesting,

208
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,180
because he hasn't
even thought about you lately.

209
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,940
Not funny.

210
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,440
Zhan Wensen is an architect Tuo admires.

211
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,870
He's happy to be working for him.

212
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:22,740
But I heard that

213
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,230
architects deal with lots of details.

214
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,270
They work long hours,

215
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,780
and have to visit construction sites.

216
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,000
It's a high-risk, high-pressure job.

217
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,060
It's really dangerous, you know.

218
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,340
Han Tuo.

219
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,070
You changed my drawings?

220
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,230
The damping wall material
in this structural plan

221
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,090
is different from what I gave you.

222
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,760
Last Friday, we had a meeting
with the structural engineers,

223
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,290
and the last point
in the meeting minutes said

224
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,600
we need to change it

225
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,920
to the latest
Japanese rubber damping wall.

226
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,660
I'm sorry,

227
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,370
I just went ahead and fixed it myself.

228
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,250
Thank you for fixing that,

229
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,450
it could've been
a fatal mistake otherwise.

230
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,650
I'm just doing my job.

231
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,060
Let me take you to dinner tonight.

232
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,340
Sure.

233
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,180
Get back to work.

234
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,120
Thank you, boss.

235
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,680
It's 8:30 PM, why isn't he back yet?

236
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,450
I'll give him a call.

237
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,710
Tuo.

238
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,450
Why are you home so late?

239
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,090
I've been waiting for you for ages.

240
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,430
Was work tough today?

241
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,300
It was okay.

242
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:07,700
Han Tuo.

243
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,980
And this is?

244
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,470
Lu Junxi.

245
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,840
My...

246
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,880
good friend.

247
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:25,910
Hello.

248
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,650
See you at the office tomorrow.

249
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,300
Sure.

250
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,050
What did you buy?

251
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,760
Dinner.

252
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,710
Let me help you carry it.

253
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,730
I'll make you a copy of my key,

254
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,910
so you won't have to wait for me anymore.

255
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,460
Okay.

256
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,250
How's your internship with Zhan Wensen?

257
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,110
It's great.

258
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,830
He even accepted
my revision suggestions today,

259
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,360
said I had done a great job.

260
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,600
That's going so smoothly.

261
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,720
It sounds great.

262
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,940
You haven't eaten yet?

263
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,310
Nope.

264
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,230
I thought we'd eat together
when you got back.

265
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,050
Zhan Wensen just treated me to dinner.

266
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:09,940
I'm sorry.

267
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,980
It's fine,

268
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,580
I'll eat by myself.

269
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,400
I'm the one who suddenly showed up,

270
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,320
thinking we haven't
seen each other in a while.

271
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,750
I'll eat with you.

272
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,320
I bought a lot.

273
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,460
If we can't finish it,

274
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,350
we'll have it for breakfast tomorrow.

275
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,350
And it'll be your turn to eat with me.

276
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,780
Go sit down and rest.

277
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,630
I'll heat up...

278
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,090
your special dinner.

279
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,390
You're up early.

280
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,130
Han Tuo,

281
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,130
no greeting?

282
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,200
Morning.

283
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,050
Why are you talking
to me with that attitude?

284
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,340
Why did Mr. Han come back so suddenly?

285
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,300
Since you're making breakfast,

286
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,500
make me one too.

287
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,080
I saw a pair of shoes at the entrance
which I have never seen before.

288
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,500
Did you have a friend staying over?

289
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,530
They're Junxi's.

290
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,690
He's still sleeping.

291
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,780
We stayed up

292
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,030
playing video games until 3 AM.

293
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,540
You're about to graduate soon.

294
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,040
You should plan ahead,

295
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,850
and prepare for your future.

296
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,640
Don't stay up all night
playing video games!

297
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,540
Is that responsible?

298
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,400
Don't act like you know me so well.

299
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,000
You haven't been home
for over a month,

300
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,800
and the moment you're back
you start lecturing me.

301
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,890
I know I've been busy with work

302
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,610
and I've neglected you.

303
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,190
It won't happen again.

304
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,730
What do you mean?

305
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,770
Do I need to greet his father?

306
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,540
This is so awkward.

307
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:18,950
Han Tuo,

308
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,660
watch your attitude right now.

309
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,950
I've been running around
on business trips for whom?

310
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,960
It's all for

311
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,240
giving you a stable life.

312
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,440
Don't say it's for me.

313
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,860
If you really cared,

314
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,850
you wouldn't have driven my mom away,

315
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,870
leaving me to live alone since I was 10.

316
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,280
When I was sick, it was Junxi's parents

317
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,880
who took me to the hospital
and looked after me.

318
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,710
Fine.

319
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,480
If I didn't work so hard every day,

320
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,680
do you think
you'd be living the life you have now?

321
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,620
So you get to arrange my life for me?

322
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,250
Han Tuo,

323
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,510
you used to listen to me.

324
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,290
How did you turn out...

325
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,420
I've had enough.

326
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,660
Good morning, Mr. Han.

327
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,030
Your dad rarely comes home.
Don't fight with him.

328
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,450
Be like Junxi.

329
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,030
Look how polite Junxi is.

330
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,490
That's because
his parents raised him well.

331
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,500
Go wash your face and brush your teeth.
Breakfast is ready.

332
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,170
But...

333
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,990
Go now.

334
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:19,930
Please.

335
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,520
Mr. Han...

336
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:28,650
Then I'll...

337
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,090
go wash up.

338
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,840
Let me tell you,

339
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,230
once the house in Kaohsiung is ready,

340
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,830
you're moving there with me.

341
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,200
I've already handed this place over
to a real estate agent,

342
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,910
so whether you like it or not,
you're moving.

343
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,150
I haven't graduated yet.

344
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,370
Don't think I don't know.

345
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,550
You've taken extra credits,

346
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,480
so you could have graduated early.

347
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,820
Tuo can graduate now.

348
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,220
Why didn't he tell me?

349
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,170
Mr. Han is so bossy.

350
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,330
The first thing he says when he's back
is to take Tuo to Kaohsiung,

351
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,780
ignoring what he wants.

352
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,090
If Tuo moves away,

353
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,680
won't we have
to keep a long-distance relationship?

354
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,320
Your dad cares about you.

355
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,800
Growing up,

356
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,410
I've had dinner at your place

357
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,540
more often than with him.

358
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,540
Tuo, do you know all the words

359
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,650
for that upcoming dictation test?

360
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,850
Yeah, I know them all.

361
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,370
But I don't know any of them.

362
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,430
You're so silly.

363
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,990
Don't say things like that.

364
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,130
Mom!

365
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,550
Wait for me!

366
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,790
You're back.

367
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,110
I made fruit sandwiches
and put them in the fridge,

368
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,470
go wash your hands before eating.

369
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,400
Okay.

370
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,760
Delicious.

371
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,830
You've got something on your lips.

372
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,430
One of my parents lied to me,

373
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,410
saying if I behave like a good kid,

374
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,870
she would come back for me.

375
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,370
The other one was never around,

376
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,680
and when he showed up,
he just gave me orders,

377
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,880
expecting me to obey without question.

378
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,650
When I chose architecture,

379
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,630
he didn't speak to me for three months.

380
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,490
Now he talks about
father and son working together,

381
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,530
forcing me to move to Kaohsiung.

382
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,330
Why are they so different
from your parents?

383
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:56,800
You can go find an accountant.

384
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,570
Dad.

385
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,160
I can't handle all this work by myself,

386
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,190
please help me out.

387
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,550
Why did they have me...

388
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,080
if they don't care about me?

389
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,600
I won't go to Kaohsiung with him.

390
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,890
I'll stay here...

391
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,690
with you.

392
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,150
Okay.

393
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,860
Try find a chance
to talk with your dad again,

394
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,150
and be polite.

395
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,670
I'll help you too.

396
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,450
If that doesn't work, we'll ask Xiaoyang.

397
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:55,900
And if Xiaoyang can't help anything,

398
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,170
we'll ask my parents.

399
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,580
They’re the same age, they might
communicate better with each other.

400
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,670
Would you like to live with me?

401
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,060
What do you mean?

402
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,600
Let's move in together.

403
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,290
Move in together?

404
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,480
[In the Next Episode]

405
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,500
We've got the Yunlong Group's

406
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,630
three business hotel design project.

407
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,680
Han Tuo,

408
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,940
I need your help with this.

409
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,310
I'll be on a work trip lately,

410
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,910
test-staying at the hotels.

411
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,660
I miss you so much these days,

412
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,260
because you're not around.

413
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,960
When it comes to relationships,

414
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,350
you're still a rookie.

415
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,920
What's wrong?

416
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,180
You must tell me
if something's bothering you.

417
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,930
I'm feeling a bit confused right now.
