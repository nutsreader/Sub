If everyone knows we're dating,

344
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,660
then no one would try to hit on you.

345
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,120
Or... you don't want that?

346
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,230
I just feel like...

347
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,450
going from best friends to lovers

348
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,210
happened too fast.

349
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,000
Can you give me some time to adjust?

350
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,840
Before I get used to it,

351
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,440
please don't kiss me
whenever you feel like it.

352
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:47,730
I like you,

353
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,770
so I want to kiss you.

354
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,100
Don't you feel the same?

355
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,160
Let's play rock-paper-scissors then.

356
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,080
If I win,

357
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
you'll do as I say.

358
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,290
You can only kiss me when I say it's okay.

359
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,050
No kissing or touching,

360
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,010
until I say it's okay.

361
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,140
Fine.

362
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,320
Rock,

363
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,260
paper,

364
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,160
scissors!

365
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,550
I won!

366
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,780
I won!

367
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,610
I actually won!

368
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,700
I have a condition.

369
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,680
What is it?

370
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,760
Only for one month.

371
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,050
No kissing or touching
unless you agree,

372
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,710
but you have to do one thing
that I really want you to do.

373
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,370
Deal.

374
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:45,190
[In the Next Episode]

375
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,540
Don't listen to Tuo's nonsense.

376
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,020
We didn't do anything.

377
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,650
Isn't that Tuo's sweater you're wearing?

378
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,570
Are you seeing anyone?

379
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:51,980
I...

380
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,570
If not, be with me.

381
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,330
Did you really do nothing,

382
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,590
or did you do everything?
