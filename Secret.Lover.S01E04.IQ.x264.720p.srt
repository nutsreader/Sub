and don't tell anyone
about their relationship.

171
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,050
Otherwise...

172
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,520
It's true that...

173
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,910
all the good guys are already taken.

174
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,530
That hurts!

175
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,990
So you do have feelings!

176
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,740
How come you didn't notice
that Youmei likes you?

177
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,150
I honestly didn't see that coming.

178
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,180
Who knew she would like me?

179
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,790
If Tuo and I hadn't seen her

180
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,750
sneaking toward the club office
after class

181
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,810
and followed her out of curiosity,

182
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,030
you would've lost your virginity
without even knowing it.

183
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,060
Lost my what?

184
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,360
I'm a guy.

185
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,110
Tuo, slow down.

186
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,930
-I can't keep up.
-Tuo is seriously mad.

187
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,110
Hope you live to see the sunrise tomorrow!

188
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,940
Don't say scary stuff like that!

189
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,870
Tuo, I want to go home.

190
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:00,760
Tuo.

191
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,630
Tuo.

192
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,270
Tuo.

193
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,710
Tuo.

194
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,070
Tuo, Tuo, Tuo.

195
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,900
Don't ignore me.

196
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,550
Say something.

197
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,860
You don't act like we're dating at all.

198
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,200
He Youmei almost...

199
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,740
I'm sorry.

200
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,090
That's why I want to
make our relationship public,

201
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,710
so no one else will
set their sights on you.

202
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,670
This time was really an accident.

203
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,150
You know that.

204
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,780
I'm not as popular as you are.

205
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,690
You don't know anything.

206
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,310
Tuo.

207
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,360
Don't be mad anymore.

208
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,950
I'm just sticking to
our no-intimacy agreement.

209
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,220
I lost.

210
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,780
I lost.

211
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,480
Even though we had this agreement,

212
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,920
you've been ignoring me for days.

213
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,880
I feel so lonely,

214
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,740
and I even wonder if you hate me.

215
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,470
I could never hate you.

216
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,610
Never.

217
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,520
According to our agreement,

218
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,760
you have to let me do what I want.

219
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,460
For a whole month,

220
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,390
I'll only kiss and hug you
when you say it's okay.

221
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,810
But you need to do something
I want with me.

222
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,120
"Something you want?"

223
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,540
Wait...

224
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,000
Hold on.

225
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,960
What?

226
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,690
We haven't decided

227
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,060
who's going to be on top

228
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,420
and who's on the bottom.

229
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,480
Let's settle this
with rock-paper-scissors.

230
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,080
Okay.

231
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,120
Your hand.

232
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,170
Wait a sec.

233
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,960
Best two out of three.

234
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,780
Top or bottom,

235
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,180
I'm fine either way,

236
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,820
as long as I'm in you.

237
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,050
You jerk.

238
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,620
Be gentle.

239
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,630
This is my first time.

240
00:15:58,930 --> 00:15:59,940
Mine too.

247
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,940
We're really doing this now.

248
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,200
What?

249
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,240
Let me help you.

250
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,920
No need. I can wash myself.

251
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,250
No, you can't.

252
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,850
Wait.

253
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,400
Wait.

254
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,390
Stop it.

255
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,840
Let's shower.

256
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,840
I am helping you shower.

257
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,200
I can't take it anymore.

258
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,670
I'll be gentle

259
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,210
this time.

260
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,280
You said that earlier too.

261
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,740
Get up, and let's have breakfast.

262
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,300
Turnip cake, soft-boiled eggs,

263
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,230
and an iced latte.

264
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,490
All the stuff you like.

265
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,830
What time is it?

266
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,540
Half past ten.

267
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,570
Ten...

268
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:22,820
You still dare to laugh?

269
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,820
Forgive me,

270
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,170
I'm inexperienced too.

271
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,790
Keep laughing,

272
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,350
and there won't be a next...

273
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,880
Good morning.

274
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,520
It's true

275
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,830
that every relationship needs a push

276
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,230
to move to the next level.

277
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,040
Don't listen to Tuo's nonsense.

278
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,290
Nothing happened.

279
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,260
The sweater you're wearing

280
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,660
is Tuo's, right?

281
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,520
So... nothing happened,

282
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,640
or everything happened,

283
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,540
Tuo?

284
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,700
Thumbs up for sure.

285
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,010
What thumbs up?

286
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,520
Congratulations.

287
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,620
For what?

288
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,800
Try touching him again
and see what happens.

289
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,120
You really need to stop.

290
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,680
You'll be in trouble
if Tuo really gets angry.

291
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,950
Wait for me!

292
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,420
I know you want to hold hands,

293
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,830
but we're at school.

294
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,010
Gotta be cautious.

295
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,210
Wait for me!

296
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,410
Alright.

297
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,690
You guys walked too fast.

298
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,640
Keep up.

299
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,380
Some friends you are.

300
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,400
It wasn't my fault.

301
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,190
-It was Tuo.
-Not you?

302
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,780
-Ditched me for some lovey-dovey time.
-He loves to walk.

303
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,720
I'm here to apologize,

304
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,390
not to steal Junxi from you.

305
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,000
I mean it.

306
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,660
I'm here to return something.

307
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,190
Thank you for helping me that day.

308
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,350
I remember now.

309
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,690
It's

310
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,680
"The Legend of the Brave," right?

311
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,020
Yes! That was the day I fell for you.

312
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,960
Not anymore, I swear.

313
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,410
I've washed your jacket.

314
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,630
Thanks for coming to my rescue that day.

315
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,290
You're welcome.

316
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,940
I'll buy you a new one.

317
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,200
If you don't want it,

318
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,900
I'll keep it as a memento.

319
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,110
Thank you, guys!

320
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,290
Wishing you two everlasting happiness!

321
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,240
I told you to keep it a secret,
and yet you're shouting it out?

322
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,300
Do you want the entire campus to know?

323
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,570
Oh, right.

324
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,890
Han Tuo is so mean.

325
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,350
Who said he was
the campus heartthrob anyway?

326
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,240
Total lies.

327
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,740
You've crossed the line.

328
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,690
Who else was he supposed to snap at?

329
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,330
You're so nice to me.

330
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,360
You're saying all this for my sake, right?

331
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,210
I get it.

332
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,220
I don't get it.

333
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,560
Can I call you "Big Sis"?

334
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,840
I was born in February.
What about you, Big Sis?

335
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,240
Your big sis here was born in April.

336
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,000
You're literally older than me.

337
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,140
Then you're my little sis, Xiaoyang.

338
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,380
From today on,

339
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,880
we're best friends!

340
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,030
I don't want that!

341
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,450
Come on, let's hold hands

342
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,750
and go to the bathroom together!

343
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,120
Who wants to hold hands with you
to go to the bathroom?

344
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,020
Then how about ranking up together
in the game?

345
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,990
No!

[Mr. Ex, it's time to pay me back!]

348
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,470
Mr. Ex,

349
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,240
it's time to pay me back.

00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,920
Han Tuo has been leaving
without saying a word lately.

353
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,520
He must be hiding something.

354
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,460
Where are you going?

355
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,950
I'm getting a cheating vibe.

356
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,840
He must be hiding something.
