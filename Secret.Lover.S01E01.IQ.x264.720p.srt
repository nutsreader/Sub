00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,630
I forgot.

177
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,690
Seriously.

178
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,610
I'll have the mixed noodle soup.

179
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,210
Okay.

180
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,350
Let me be clear,

181
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,650
I can teach you,

182
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,540
but...

183
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,240
But what?

184
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,910
No doubts,

185
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,710
no resistance,

186
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,570
and no regrets.

187
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,500
Can you do that?

188
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:48,830
Lu Junxi,

189
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,810
you like me.

190
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,790
No doubts,

191
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,420
no resistance,

192
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:52,920
and no regrets.

193
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,790
Can you do that?

194
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,340
Yes,

195
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,160
I like you.

196
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,210
I will never doubt,

197
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:57,830
never resist,

198
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,760
never regret,

199
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,120
or I'm a puppy if I can't.

200
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,110
When do you want to confess?

201
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,050
After the welcome party.

202
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,580
Right after the welcome party.

203
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,360
You like Lin Xiaoyang that much?

204
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,540
You've had girlfriend after girlfriend
since high school.

205
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,240
And here I am—a sophomore,

206
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,820
still at zero...

207
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:25,940
Wait,

208
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,260
just call her Xiaoyang.

209
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,260
We've been a trio since we were kids.

210
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,790
Why are you calling her by her full name?

211
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,450
Do you really know what it means
to like someone?

212
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,700
Of course,

213
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,000
liking someone means
always wanting to be together,

214
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,830
just like...

215
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,440
Like what?

216
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,860
Class begins, Coach.

217
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,530
Tell me first,

218
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,730
how do you plan to confess?

219
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,830
I don't know.

220
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,450
Tomorrow at 4 PM,

221
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,190
meet me at the entrance of Dongle Cinema.

222
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,390
Are you going to give me a live demo?

223
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,710
If you could get a relationship
just by studying theory,

224
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,010
every goblin

225
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,430
would have a girlfriend.

226
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,320
Fair enough.

227
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,040
So, that's the plan.

228
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,450
See you tomorrow.

229
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,840
Getting hit on again?

230
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,710
He's such a chick magnet.

231
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,700
It's so good to be handsome.

232
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,720
You're not bad-looking yourself.

233
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,640
I've already bought the tickets.

234
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,740
Your favorite.

235
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,040
A sci-fi movie?

236
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,710
Isn't a romance movie the right choice
for the demo lesson?

237
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,640
What do you like?

238
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,740
Sci-fi movies.

239
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,620
Choose what she likes

240
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,710
to appeal to her taste?

241
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,880
I got it.

242
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:30,670
Popcorn?

243
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,150
Sweet ones. Got everything you like.

244
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,890
Let's go.

245
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,610
You're seriously good at this.

246
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,580
No wonder so many girls like you.

247
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,630
Come a bit closer.

248
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,610
Finally...

249
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,380
we're almost there.

250
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,370
Only...

251
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,590
only 20 light-years to go.

252
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,050
Then I'll speed up.

253
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,440
Come up a bit.

254
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,060
That's enough.

255
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,040
I thought you wanted me to go harder.

256
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,300
Why does this sci-fi movie

257
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,150
have so many steamy scenes?

258
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,420
Tuo, what are you doing?

259
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,180
He really is a pro.

260
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,870
Damn,

261
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,800
why am I getting aroused now?

262
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,670
Are you okay?

263
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,370
I'm fine.

264
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,470
Really?

265
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,320
Why are you smiling?

266
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,510
You're the same.

267
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,410
Should we

268
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,560
help each other out?

269
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,370
Help with what?

270
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,900
Was it good?

271
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,040
The trailer was pretty good.

272
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,270
Hold on.

273
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,600
But it was kinda boring.

274
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,620
A complete waste of time.

275
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,670
It was okay.

276
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,260
The lead actress was pretty,

277
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,660
just my type.

278
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,670
What are you doing...

279
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,430
Isn't the demonstration

280
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,940
going a little too far?

281
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:57,880
Wait a sec.

282
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,550
Did you hear something?

283
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,570
Hold on, Tuo.

284
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,970
Your hand, Tuo...

285
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,200
Can you hold back?

286
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,250
What was that?

287
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,180
Junxi!

288
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:04,990
Tuo!

289
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,980
Where on earth did you two go?

290
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,010
You didn't even pick up your phones.

291
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,480
We just finished watching a movie.

292
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,369
I suddenly remembered
that I have something to do.

293
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,400
Gotta go.

294
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,430
Wait.

295
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,119
We still need to talk about
our beach trip this weekend.

296
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,849
This year marks the 10th anniversary
of our trio.

297
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,200
You two can decide without me.

298
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,250
Lu Junxi!

299
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,420
What's up with him?

300
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,430
The movie was too boring,

301
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,090
so he was probably just tired.

302
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,850
Ocean, here I come!

303
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,540
Hurry up, you guys!

304
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,110
You said we'd go to a new beach,

305
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,110
but we ended up at the same old place.

306
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,340
Let me help you with that.

307
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,210
It's okay.

308
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,060
You and Xiaoyang go ahead first

309
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,320
and grab us a good spot.

310
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,740
I can manage, Tuo.

311
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,470
Nice shot.

312
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,740
Good one, good one.

313
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,440
Nice one!

314
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,670
Got it, got it.

315
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,210
Catch it.

316
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,330
What was that?

317
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,650
You're not playing with them.

318
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,780
Aren't you afraid someone else might
win Xiaoyang over?

319
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,940
That's none of your business.

320
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:52,860
Junxi.

321
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,930
Junxi, Tuo,

322
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,880
come play volleyball!

323
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,540
Let's play three-on-three!

324
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,250
Hurry up!

325
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,690
You didn't put on any sunscreen.

326
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:02,590
If you play like this,

327
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,520
you'll definitely get sunburned.

328
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,100
Let's play! Let's play!

329
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,360
Xiaoyang, I'm coming!

330
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,760
Too soft.

331
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,750
Junxi, Tuo,

332
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,820
smile.

333
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,120
Beach trip

334
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,130
and taking an instant photo.

335
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,390
After all these years,

336
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,880
don't you ever get tired of it?

337
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,050
Never.

338
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,970
I always carry the photo from the day
our trio officially formed

339
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,440
with me everywhere.

340
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,860
You've kept it all this time?

341
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,060
Of course.

342
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,900
It's been 10 years,

343
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,830
and we're still so close.

344
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,290
That's not easy to come by.

345
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,590
We should cherish it,

346
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,910
don't you think?

347
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,490
Time flies.

348
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,760
It's been 10 years since I met Tuo.

349
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,740
So,

350
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,840
if you two are fighting, make up quickly.

351
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,010
Don't sulk.

352
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,440
We're here to have fun.

353
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,870
-We're not fighting.
-We're not fighting.

354
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,030
I hope not,

355
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,860
but I'd be a fool to believe that.

356
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,160
As usual,

357
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:49,950
I get one room,

358
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,110
and you two share another.

359
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,910
Which one of you wants to come
and draw the room key?

360
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,630
I'll draw then.

361
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,310
You guys better not regret it.

362
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,320
Tuo.

363
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,160
Help me take my luggage upstairs too.

364
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,960
Okay.

365
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,000
Make up soon, will you?

366
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,140
We're not fighting.

367
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,900
Then why is it so awkward between you two?

368
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,970
That's because...

369
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,690
We're fighting.

370
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,940
Whatever you're fighting about,
don't give him the silent treatment.

371
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,960
Don't ignore him.

372
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,360
Remember?

373
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,670
Back when Tuo first moved into
our neighborhood,

374
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,780
he was super shy.

375
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,750
He didn't like interacting with others

376
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,950
and wasn't good at expressing himself.

377
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,290
It took you a very long time

378
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,690
to break the ice with him.

379
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:10,370
And he gradually started enjoying talking
to others

380
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,030
and expressing his thoughts.

381
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,360
I've forgotten

382
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,980
what Tuo used to be like.

383
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,390
So

384
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,720
don't ignore him,

385
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,750
or he'll think you hate him.

386
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,960
If you miss the chance to make up

387
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,660
and our trio loses a member,

388
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,950
I'll beat you up.

389
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,240
Alright, I got it.

390
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,040
Good.

391
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,860
Okay,

392
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,790
I'll go back to my room and unpack.

393
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,940
I've scheduled a morning call
for 7 AM tomorrow,

394
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,800
and then we'll meet in the living room
for breakfast.

395
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,660
Good night.

396
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,250
I...

397
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,000
I'll go take a shower first.

398
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,710
Why does it have to be a double bed,
of all times?

399
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,510
Do you want to go first, or should I?

400
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,450
I'll go first.

401
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,460
No,

402
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,330
Tuo.

403
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,190
Tuo.

404
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,930
No!

405
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:13,070
[In the Next Episode]

406
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,080
Tuo.

407
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,650
Where have you been lately?

408
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,390
I went to your place
but couldn't find you,

409
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,940
and you didn't reply to my messages.

410
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,120
Does it bother you?

411
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,060
I...

412
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,400
I don't want to just be your friend.

413
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,700
I want to be with you...

414
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,680
to be your boyfriend.
